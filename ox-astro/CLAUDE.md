It appears the "strip and replace" strategy in the final filter is proving brittle. A much cleaner and more robust solution is to prevent the parent `md` backend from generating its front matter in the first place. This way, your final filter's only job is to *add* your custom front matter, completely avoiding the duplication issue and any state-related bugs.

The `ox-md` backend decides whether to add front matter based on the `:with-front-matter` export option. By overriding this option in your derived backend and setting it to `nil`, you can disable the behavior entirely.

Here is the definitive two-step fix.

-----

### Step 1: Disable Parent Front Matter Generation

In your `org-export-define-derived-backend` definition at the end of the file, you need to add an entry to the `:options-alist` that overrides the parent's default behavior.

Add the line `(:with-front-matter nil)` to the `:options-alist`. This tells the `md` backend to skip generating its own front matter block.

```elisp
;; In `org-export-define-derived-backend`

(org-export-define-derived-backend 'astro 'md
  :menu-entry
  '(?a "Export to Astro"
       ((?a "As MDX buffer" org-astro-export-as-mdx)
        (?x "To MDX file" org-astro-export-to-mdx)
        (?o "To MDX file and open"
            (lambda (_a _s _v _b)
              (org-open-file
               (org-astro-export-to-mdx))))))

  :translate-alist
  '((src-block . org-astro-src-block)
    (link . org-astro-link)
    (headline . org-astro-heading)
    (paragraph . org-astro-paragraph)
    (plain-text . org-astro-plain-text))

  :filters-alist
  '((:filter-parse-tree . org-astro-prepare-images-filter)
    (:filter-body . org-astro-body-filter)
    (:filter-final-output . org-astro-final-output-filter))

  :options-alist
  '(;; ADD THIS LINE TO DISABLE THE PARENT'S FRONT MATTER
    (:with-front-matter    nil) 
    ;; The rest of your options follow
    (:smart-quotes         nil                   org-md-use-smart-quotes nil)
    (:title              "TITLE"               nil nil nil)
    (:author             "AUTHOR"              nil nil nil)
    (:author-image       "AUTHOR_IMAGE"        nil nil nil)
    ;; ... and so on
    ))
```

### Step 2: Simplify the Final Filter

Now that the incoming `output` string for your final filter will be clean (i.e., it won't have any front matter), you can remove the complex regex that tried to strip it. This makes the function much simpler and less prone to error.

Replace your entire `org-astro-final-output-filter` function with this simplified version:

```elisp
(defun org-astro-final-output-filter (output _backend info)
  "Final filter for Astro export.
- Adds custom front matter and import statements.
- Replaces HTML entities with literal characters.
- Converts indented example blocks to Markdown blockquotes.
- Converts markdown image syntax to Astro's Image component."
  (let* ((s output)
         ;; Generate our front matter (parent's is now disabled)
         (tree (plist-get info :parse-tree))
         (front-matter-data (org-astro--get-front-matter-data tree info))
         (front-matter-string (org-astro--gen-yaml-front-matter front-matter-data))
         ;; Get imports from body filter
         (all-imports (plist-get info :astro-all-imports))
         ;; HTML entities
         (s (replace-regexp-in-string "&#x2013;" "--" s t t))
         (s (replace-regexp-in-string "&rsquo;" "'" s t t))
         (s (replace-regexp-in-string "&lsquo;" "'" s t t))
         (s (replace-regexp-in-string "&rdquo;" "\"" s t t))
         (s (replace-regexp-in-string "&ldquo;" "\"" s t t))
         ;; Convert markdown image syntax with absolute paths to Image components
         (image-imports (plist-get info :astro-body-images-imports))
         (s (if image-imports
                (replace-regexp-in-string
                 "!\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\](\\(/[^)]+\\.\\(?:png\\|jpe?g\\)\\))"
                 (lambda (match)
                   (let* ((alt (match-string 1 match))
                          (path (match-string 2 match))
                          (image-data (cl-find path image-imports
                                               :key (lambda (item) (plist-get item :path))
                                               :test #'string-equal)))
                     (if image-data
                         (let ((var-name (plist-get image-data :var-name)))
                           (format "<Image src={%s} alt=\"%s\" />" var-name (or alt "")))
                       match)))
                 s)
              s))
         ;; Indented blocks to blockquotes
         (lines (split-string s "\n"))
         (processed-lines
          (mapcar (lambda (line)
                    (if (string-prefix-p "    " line)
                        (concat "> " (substring line 4))
                      line))
                  lines))
         (s (mapconcat 'identity processed-lines "\n")))
    ;; Return final result with front matter + imports + content
    (concat front-matter-string
            (if (and all-imports (not (string-blank-p all-imports)))
                (concat all-imports "\n\n")
              "")
            s)))
```

These two changes work together to eliminate the root cause of the problem. Your exporter will now be truly stateless and produce a clean, correct MDX file every time you run it.
