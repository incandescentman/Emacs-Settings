---

## üéØ Audience Profile

**Who's in the room:**
- Mix of legacy PopTech members (Metcalfe-era) + younger, global leaders
- Pulitzer Prize-winning writers
- Academics and university presidents
- Creative industry professionals
- Strategists and design/branding experts
- Global health researchers
- Human Rights Foundation representatives

**Their relationship with AI:**

- 3-4 other AI talks at the conference (including Sarah Siskind's "Baby vs Bot" and someone named Sondra with a more cautionary approach)

**What they need from you:**
- Reframing: AI as enhancer of creativity, not replacement
- Provocation: "What if the real risk isn't that AI replaces human creativity, but that we fail to use it to expand human creativity?"
- Possibility over catastrophe
- Practical understanding of AI as tool for strategy, research, writing, and imagination

---

## üí° Your Unique Positioning

**Why you're perfect for this:**
- Uniquely credible at the **intersection of writing, creativity, education, and AI**
- One of very few people expert in BOTH writing/education AND AI
- Most academics hate/avoid AI ‚Äî you understand both sides deeply
- Former Head of Community for Writers at OpenAI
- You're not "AI does the work for you" ‚Äî you're **"AI as sparring partner, sounding board, and amplifier of human creativity"**

**Your stance:**
- Optimistic and imaginative, but grounded
- Not a doom talk, but a **"realm of possibility"** talk
- The big "aha": **AI as a partner in thinking, not a replacement for thinking**

**Powerful anecdotes to weave in:**
- **Your mother and ChatGPT story:** She asked it the capital of Canada; you reframed the possibility: "try asking how to make new friends in your building"
- "Most writers/professors hate AI, so they don't engage ‚Äî meaning I'm one of the few who really understands both sides"

---

## üé§ Main Stage Talk

**Total time:** 20-25 minutes including interaction

**Structure (NOT a traditional 15-minute talk):**

1. **10 minutes:** Frame up your topic, entice the audience
   - Open with possibility, not fear
   - Position AI as creative amplifier
   - Set up the central theme

2. **Interactive assignment (immediate):** "Get your phone out, let's do something"
   - Give specific prompt/challenge
   - Example: "Ask ChatGPT a question you wouldn't normally think to ask"
   - Make audience members co-creators in discovering new possibilities

3. **10-12 minutes:** Hands up, share experiences, back-and-forth dialogue
   - Real-time responses
   - Build on what people discover
   - Let the room energy guide the conversation

4. **3 minutes:** Close it out
   - Callback to central theme
   - Example closer: "AI won't replace creativity. It can spark and amplify it ‚Äî but only if you stay in the driver's seat"
   - Leave them with the reframed possibility

**Key themes to hit:**
- "Realm of possibility" ‚Äî counter the doom narrative
- AI as creative partner, thinking partner, sounding board
- How to use AI ethically in writing, research, strategy
- Show people what they haven't imagined yet

**Delivery advice:**
- **Think TED-style tight framing** in the opening 10 minutes
- **The more interactive, the better** ‚Äî they really want audience participation
- Don't just lecture ‚Äî make it conversational
- Treat the close like a callback

---

## üéì Afternoon Masterclass Workshop

**Time:** Day 2 (Oct 9), 2:30-3:30pm  
**Format:** Hands-on, small group (10-15 participants, capped)  
**Requirements:** Laptop required

**Target audience:**
- NOT early adopters
- Professionals asking "How do I use these tools effectively in my daily work?"
- Curious but not experts
- Want practical techniques for workplace/daily life

**Approach:**
- Laptops open
- Try exercises in real time
- Practical approaches and techniques
- Depth over breadth

**Possible class titles:**
- "AI as Your Thinking Partner"
- "Beyond Automation: How to Use AI to Think Better"
- "From Blank Page to Breakthrough: Practical AI for Creativity"
- "Socratic AI: How to Use AI to Ask Better Questions"

**Tagline options:**
- "Not shortcuts, but sharper thinking"
- "AI won't write for you ‚Äî but it can help you write better"
- "How to make AI your sparring partner, not your substitute"

---

## üåç Strategic Opportunities

**Think of this as a springboard** (Leetha's explicit advice: "See your talk in the context of what you want to do next")

**Key connections in the room:**
- The Signal (DC media brand) ‚Äî does interviews, transcribes/publishes a week later
- Human Rights Foundation ‚Äî "AI for Individual Rights" program (Craig Buchanan)
- South by Southwest team
- Various media partners
- University presidents (potential AI educator role contacts)
- Creative industry leaders (potential consulting/advisory opportunities)

**How this positions you:**
- Platform for industry role (AI company like Anthropic or Google)
- Platform for university AI educator role
- Visibility as thought leader at AI/creativity intersection
- Intimate venue = deeper connections than big conference
- Engaged audience that NEEDS what you know

---

## ‚úÖ Action Items

**For the main talk:**
1. Prepare 10-minute framing story
2. Design interactive exercise (10 minutes)
3. Craft 3-minute closing callback

**For the masterclass:**
1. Choose final title
2. Write blurb/description
3. Create simple graphic (PopTech may help promote)
4. Design hands-on exercises for 60 minutes

**Strategic prep:**
1. Think about springboard positioning
2. Prepare elevator pitch for "what's next"
3. Research key attendees for targeted networking
