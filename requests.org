Not all women read romance novels, but a great many do. So many, in fact, that 13 percent of all paperbook sales are romance novels. Harlequin alone published 100 romance novels a month---all around the world and published in 32 languages, [fn:: [[skim:///Users/jay/devonthink-databases/book.dtBase2/Files.noindex/pdf/f/Pop%20Culture%20of%20Sex-%20An%20Evolutionary%20Window%20on%20the%20Worlds%20of%20Pornography%20and%20Romance.pdf::1][pop Culture of Sex- An Evolutionary Window on the Worlds of Pornography and Romance.pdf, p. 1]]].

* region or thing

** highlighted region or thing at point
 I use several functions that do dictionary lookups of the "thing at point." 
1. gnugol-word-at-point, which is a function that does (defun gnugol-word-at-point ()
  (interactive)
(gnugol-search-google (thing-at-point 'word))
) 
gnugol-search-google is defined in gnugol.el
2. define-word-at-point, which is an interactive autoloaded
Lisp closure in define-word.el' 

These both work fine. However, I'd like to be able to highlight a 2-word or 3-word PHRASE (i.e. select the region) and THEN invoke gnugol-word-at-point or define-word-at-point and have gnugol or define-word look up the entire phrase.

Can you implement a functionality for these two functions that allows me to do "lookup active region or if no active region then lookup word at point"?

Thanks!

So that I have two words highlighted and I run gnugol-word-at-point, it first takes the highlighted region as the entire query.

* TODO kill-clause
** NOTE-TO-JAY Questions 
     Regarding ~pasteboard-cut~, I think it's rather straightforward. Please give it a go.

     As for ~kill-line~, there's something I should clarify: this is a builtin command (comes with Emacs), so it's not something I can easily change. Except that Emacs Lisp has a nice little functionality called "advicing", which allows dynamically adding behaviour to functions without having access to their code. I could do this to ~kill-line~. However, this is usually not recommended, since it could mess up other functionalities that might depend on the default ~kill-line~ implementation. Anyway, since you have the ~my/kill-line-dwim~ function, isn't that the one you use?

     Finally, regarding ~kill-clause~, I added the requested functionality, but I realised the implementation has several probably undesired behaviours. For example:

: This is a test sentence^, nothing to see here. And then another.

     Caret marks the point. In this case, calling ~kill-clause~ results in:

: This is a test sentence, ^nothing to see here. And then another.

     I.e. it only moves point. Please confirm that it should yield:

: This is a test sentence^. And then another.

     Now, going back to the current result of ~kill-clause~:

: This is a test sentence, ^nothing to see here. And then another.

     If you now invoke ~kill-clause~, you'll have:

: This is a test sentence, . ^And then another.

     This also seems silly. Again, it would seem reasonable to produce:

: This is a test sentence^. And then another.

     Finally, I found an edge case:

: This is a test sentence, nothing to see here. ^And then another.<EOB>

     Where <EOB> marks the end of the buffer. In this case, nothing happens when you invoke ~kill-clause~. I suppose it should kill the entire sentence:

: This is a test sentence, nothing to see here.^<EOB>

     Correct?

** NOTE-TO-RÚDI Answers for kill-clause below.

This is a test sentence^, nothing to see here. And then another.

     Caret marks the point. In this case, calling ~kill-clause~ results in:

This is a test sentence, ^nothing to see here. And then another.

     I.e. it only moves point. Please confirm that it should yield:

This is a test sentence^. And then another.

: Yes! Confirmed, that is what it should yield. 

     Now, going back to the current result of ~kill-clause~:

This is a test sentence, ^nothing to see here. And then another.

     If you now invoke ~kill-clause~, you'll have:

This is a test sentence, . ^And then another.

     This also seems silly. Again, it would seem reasonable to produce:

This is a test sentence^. And then another.

: Yes, exactly! That would be the desired behavior. However, the optimal point placement for that case would be this:
This is a test sentence. ^And then another.


     Finally, I found an edge case:

This is a test sentence, nothing to see here. ^And then another.<EOB>

     Where <EOB> marks the end of the buffer. In this case, nothing happens when you invoke ~kill-clause~. I suppose it should kill the entire sentence:

This is a test sentence, nothing to see here.^<EOB>

     Correct?

: Correct! Thanks for thoroughly thinking through these cases, much appreciated! 

** NOTE-TO-RÚDI Comments about my edits to kill-clause-test-file.el 
What a brilliant approach, to create the test file! Here are some notes about my edits to the file.

Kill-clause should only kill one clause, which I think means it should only ever kill one comma, not two. So for the example below, it should leave the second comma in. I edited the desired output in kill-clause-test-file.el.

Input: We should consider^, for completeness, comma separated clauses. 
Your suggested output: We should consider^ comma separated clauses.
My desired output: We should consider^, comma separated clauses. 

Same for this one:

Input: We should consider,^ for completeness, comma separated clauses.
Your suggested output: We should consider^ comma separated clauses.
My desired output: We should consider,^ comma separated clauses. 

And this one:

Input: We should consider, ^for completeness, comma separated clauses.
Your suggested output: We should consider^ comma separated clauses.
My desired output: We should consider, ^comma separated clauses. 

With the example below, it should kill the question mark and leave the period. And the point should be before the period.

Input: And what about two consecutive sentences^? That's important too.
Your suggested output: And what about two consecutive sentences?^
My desired output: And what about two consecutive sentences^.

With the example below, I probably would never have the input you mentioned. I changed the syntax of the input to match the case I'm more likely to encounter. 

Your suggested input: ^Let's not forget parenthesis (those are extremely important!)
My more likely input: ^Let's not forget parenthesis (those are extremely important)! 
Output: (^Those are extremely important)! 

Same for this one:

Your suggested input: Let's not forget parenthesis ^(those are extremely important!) 
My more likely input: Let's not forget parenthesis ^(those are extremely important)! 
Output: Let's not forget parenthesis^! 

Thanks!

*** NOTE-TO-RÚDI Question about spaces?
It works! Now, next question. Currently, when I type spaces between words in the heading, the space between the words and the tag gets collapsed. (Obviously it does, since I have <SPC> bound to jay/insert-space.) Is it easy to make it so that I can type spaces in the heading with collapsing the spaces between the heading and the tag? If it's too complicated, I can solve this problem on the "user side" by trying to remember to use M-SPC (insert-space) whenever I'm in an org-mode heading with a tag.

* cycle contraction
I want an Emacs lisp function I can call that will automatically convert a two-word phrase (e.g. "do not") into its English contraction (e.g. "don't"). Maybe we would call it cycle-contraction.

For example, let's say I have this sentence:

: I do not want to see the movie.

And let's say the point is on the space between "do" and "not."

If I invoke cycle-contraction, Emacs should convert "do not" to "don't" so the sentence would look like this:

: I don't want to see the movie.

Conversely, if the point is somewhere on the word "couldn't" and I call cycle-contraction, it should convert it to the long-form-phrase "could not".

We would define each long-form-phrase and its contraction as a list of pairs, maybe something like this:

(setq contraction-pairs
(
(("do not") ("don't"))
(("will not") ("won't"))
(("could not") ("couldn't"))
))

Test: kill "To potential heterosexual men."
