* org-inline-tags

To insert an inline tag, press =C-c i t= in org-mode. You will be
prompted with a list of pre-defined tags. Type the first letter of the
desired tag to insert it at the cursor position.

Here's the list of pre-defined tags and their corresponding single
keystroke:

- r: "review"
- b: "book"
- t: "todo"
- u: "urgent"
- p: "tweet"
- i: "insight"
- c: "cook-ideas-over-time"

For example, typing =C-c i t= followed by =r= will insert =::review::=
at the cursor position.

To search for a specific inline tag in the current buffer, use the
=org-inline-tag-search= function. Type =M-x org-inline-tag-search=
followed by the name of the tag (e.g., =review=) to search for it in the
current buffer.

You can customize the appearance of inline tags by adding the following
code to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_example
emacs(defface org-inline-tag '((t (:foreground "cyan" :background "black" :bold t))) "Face for inline tags")
(font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("(::w+::)" 1 'org-inline-tag prepend)) 'append)
#+end_example

This code snippet defines a custom face for inline tags, and adds a
font-lock keyword to apply the face to inline tags in org-mode.
Customize the =:foreground=, =:background=, and other face properties to
your preference.


** Why org-inline-tags?
Org-mode is a powerful tool for organizing and managing information.
While org-mode headings and TODO items are useful for organizing tasks
and ideas, sometimes you need a way to flag plain list items for later
review or action. =org-inline-tags= provides a simple, customizable
solution for tagging plain list items with custom inline tags, making it
easier to review, prioritize, and manage your notes.
