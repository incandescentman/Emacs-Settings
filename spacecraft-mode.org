** smart punctuation

*** kill-clause
~Kill-clause~ kills (cuts) a clause in the text and makes various fixes to punctuation and spacing.

1. ~(smart-expand)~: call expand-abbrev on any unexpanded words.
3. Check if the cursor is at a comma, semicolon, or colon and moves one character to the right if so.
4. The function determines whether to kill the entire line or just a portion of it, based on specific conditions.
5. The function makes several fixes to punctuation and spacing, such as:
  - Removing extra spaces before punctuation marks
  - Deleting incorrect combinations of punctuation marks and spaces
  - Capitalizing the first letter of a sentence unless it's an Org mode heading
6. The function ensures the cursor is left at an appropriate position, either before or after punctuation, depending on the context.

** TODO [#A] check my changes to backward-kill-word-correctly?
Rúdi: desired behavior is that when invoking backward-kill-word-correctly to delete words backwards, Emacs should leave a space after the word to the left of the point UNLESS point is at the beginning of the line or after "--"

I tried to implement this myself, below. My hack seems to work, but it seems slow... Is it possible to make it faster or no? maybe just than a look at the below and see if you think I implemented it in the best way.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun backward-kill-word-correctly ()
  "Kill word."
  (interactive)
(with-silent-modifications
  (if (re-search-backward "\\>\\W*[[:punct:]]+\\W*\\=" nil t)
      (kill-region (match-end 0) (match-beginning 0))
    (backward-kill-word 1))
  (my/fix-space)

;; I added this ↓↓↓ #######################
(when (and
(not (looking-back "--")) ; I added this
(not (looking-back "^"))) ; I added this
;; I added this ↑↑↑ #######################

#+END_SRC

*** NOTE-TO-JAY Question

   Since ~backward-kill-word-correctly~ already calls ~my/fix-space~, isn't a call to ~smart-space~ redundant? What was the use case you were thinking of when you originally added it? Note that if you remove the whole ~(when ...)~ block, it apparently works as you intend it to work...

*** NOTE-TO-SERJ Answer
Good question. The answer is that there should never be a space after "---"

Example:
: Alice was tired---tired as hell. ^

Say the point is the carat, and I invoke backward-kill-word-correctly 4 times.

Output if I remove the whole ~(when ...)~ block:
: Alice was tired--- ^
Note the space after "---"

Desired output:
: Alice was tired---^
No space. Does that make sense? Thanks!
