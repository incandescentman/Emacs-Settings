Nice! 🎉 That title strikes a strong balance: it’s personal (your name), professional (AI expertise), and distinctive (Socratic, tying back to your teaching/writing philosophy). It signals that this isn’t just another AI newsletter—it’s *your* perspective, rooted in conversation, ethics, and thoughtfulness.

A few things you might want to consider next:

* **Tagline / Subtitle**
  A sharp one-liner under the title that makes your value proposition instantly clear. Examples:

  * *How to use AI thoughtfully—without outsourcing your thinking.*
  * *AI for writers, educators, and thinkers who want to grow their skills, not replace them.*
  * *Using AI to amplify creativity, not automate it.*

* **About Page Blurb**
  A short paragraph introducing who you are, what readers will get, and why it matters. Something like:

  > *I’m Jay Dixit—writer, professor, and AI educator. This newsletter explores how to use AI thoughtfully and ethically in writing, learning, and creative work. Instead of shortcuts or prose generation, I show how AI can serve as a sounding board, brainstorming partner, and creative collaborator—helping you sharpen your own thinking and voice.*

* **First Post**
  Could be a “Welcome” post setting the tone. Something like:
  *Why Socratic AI?* — explaining the concept (not AI as an oracle giving answers, but as a dialogue partner asking questions).

Want me to draft a polished **subtitle + about page + welcome post outline** so you’ve got the whole launch package ready?
