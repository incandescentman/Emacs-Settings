Perfect --- that's the right instinct. If you write these pieces yourself, they'll sound unmistakably like *you*, which is what will draw people in. Let me walk you through the process and some levers you can pull to make your Substack launch stronger.

*** 1. Clarify your audience

Before you write anything, ask:

- Who do you want reading this? Professors? Writers? Students? AI-curious professionals?
- Do you want it to feel like a niche intellectual salon, or a broader public education resource?
- The more specific you are, the easier it is to shape your tagline, about blurb, and first post.

ðŸ‘‰ Advice: Write down *one specific person* you imagine reading. "This is for a mid-career professor who's overwhelmed by AI and doesn't want to feel out of touch." Then write to them.

*** 2. Nail your *title + subtitle* balance

- Your title *already* carries your name and "Socratic AI." That gives authority and differentiation.
* The subtitle should deliver your *promise*: what readers will get from subscribing.

  - It can be inspirational ("Amplifying human creativity in the age of AI")
  - Practical ("Clear strategies for using AI to think better, write better, and teach better")
  - Or positioning ("For writers and educators who want to use AI without outsourcing their thinking").

ðŸ‘‰ Advice: Draft 5-6 subtitles, even if they feel repetitive. Read them out loud. The one that feels crispest and most you is the one.

*** 3. Shape your *About page*

Readers skim this quickly --- so think of it like the back cover of a book:

- *Who you are* (build credibility without overloading your resume)
* *What this newsletter is about* (1-2 sentences, max)
* *Why it matters* (what problem you're helping readers solve, or what transformation they'll get)
- *What they'll actually receive* (weekly essays, case studies, thought experiments, classroom tips, etc.)

ðŸ‘‰ Advice: Imagine someone lands on your Substack with only 10 seconds before deciding to subscribe. What's the one sentence you'd want them to walk away with? That should lead.

*** 4. Craft your *first post*

Instead of a generic "Welcome to my Substack," try:

- Frame it as a *manifesto*: Why Socratic AI exists, what it's *against* (outsourcing thinking), and what it's *for* (dialogue, learning, creativity).
- Tell a *story*: e.g., the moment you realized AI could be a tool for learning rather than a shortcut.
- Give a *clear takeaway*: what readers will consistently get if they stick around.

ðŸ‘‰ Advice: Don't overstuff. Better to leave people curious for the next post than to try to cover everything in one.

*** 5. Cadence + categories

- Decide if this is *weekly, biweekly, or "as inspired."* Consistency matters more than frequency.
- Sketch 3-4 *recurring themes* (e.g., "AI & Education," "AI & Writing," "Practical Experiments," "Case Studies"). This helps readers know what to expect and helps you when you sit down to draft.

*** 6. Voice & tone

Your advantage is you're not "just another AI explainer." You're *Jay Dixit*, and your brand is smart, thoughtful, clear, sometimes funny, never buzzwordy.

* Keep the tone conversational but authoritative.
* Use stories, classroom moments, and writing analogies --- they're your edge.

Would you like me to run through a *step-by-step exercise* where I ask you questions (like your "imaginary reader" exercise) and you answer them, so you end up with raw material for your subtitle, About, and first post?
