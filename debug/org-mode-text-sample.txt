* Workflowy Mode

** Analysis: What Makes Workflowy Work

*** Core Mechanics

**The fundamental loop is frictionless:**
- Type → Enter → New bullet appears
- Your cursor is immediately ready to type again
- No clicking, no menus, no "create new item" buttons

**Indentation feels natural:**
- Tab indents (makes current bullet a child of the one above)
- Shift-Tab outdents (promotes it back up a level)
- The visual hierarchy updates instantly—you see the structure as you think

*** Interaction Model

Workflowy's note entry is built on a **flat text field illusion**—it looks like a word processor but behaves like an outliner.
The mental model is *typing → press Enter → new idea*. Everything else (nesting, moving, editing) stays consistent with that rhythm.
