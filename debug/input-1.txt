Perfect—that’s the right instinct. If you write these pieces yourself, they’ll sound unmistakably like *you*, which is what will draw people in. Let me walk you through the process and some levers you can pull to make your Substack launch stronger.

### 1. Clarify your audience

Before you write anything, ask:

* Who do you want reading this? Professors? Writers? Students? AI-curious professionals?
* Do you want it to feel like a niche intellectual salon, or a broader public education resource?
* The more specific you are, the easier it is to shape your tagline, about blurb, and first post.

👉 Advice: Write down **one specific person** you imagine reading. “This is for a mid-career professor who’s overwhelmed by AI and doesn’t want to feel out of touch.” Then write to them.

### 2. Nail your **title + subtitle** balance

* Your title *already* carries your name and “Socratic AI.” That gives authority and differentiation.
* The subtitle should deliver your **promise**: what readers will get from subscribing.

  * It can be inspirational (“Amplifying human creativity in the age of AI”)
  * Practical (“Clear strategies for using AI to think better, write better, and teach better”)
  * Or positioning (“For writers and educators who want to use AI without outsourcing their thinking”).

👉 Advice: Draft 5–6 subtitles, even if they feel repetitive. Read them out loud. The one that feels crispest and most you is the one.
