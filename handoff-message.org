#+TITLE: Handoff Message: Emacs Info Debugging Session
#+DATE: 2025-10-14

* Summary
The primary goal is to fix the Emacs Info system, which fails to find the "Calendar/Diary" documentation in the user's interactive Spacemacs session. After extensive debugging, we have concluded that the problem lies within the interactive configuration and the standard Homebrew Info files.

The user is restarting this session from the parent directory, `/Users/jay/emacs/`, to grant access to both the configuration (`emacs-settings`) and the newly cloned Emacs source code (`emacs-fresh-source`).

* Key Findings (The "Grand Unified Theory")
1.  The user's interactive Spacemacs environment aggressively mismanages `Info-directory-list`, making the standard Info directory system unreliable.
2.  The Homebrew-provided `emacs.info.gz` file is structured in a way that makes the `Calendar/Diary` node inaccessible via the directory system, even though a `Diary` node exists.
3.  A clean, minimal batch script *can* access the node, proving the underlying Emacs installation and Info files are not corrupt.
4.  Therefore, the problem is a conflict within the user's interactive configuration that breaks the standard Info lookup process.

* The Proven Solution (From User's Notes)
The user discovered notes from a previous machine that detail a successful solution to this exact problem. The strategy is to bypass the broken Info directory system entirely.

The plan is as follows:
1.  Clone the official GNU Emacs source code.
2.  Build the complete `emacs.info` manual from source using `make`.
3.  Modify the user's Emacs configuration to open this newly-built `emacs.info` file directly by its absolute path.

* Current Status
Step 1 of the plan is complete. The user has successfully cloned the Emacs source code into the following directory:
- `/Users/jay/emacs/emacs-fresh-source/`

* IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP
The very next action is to execute Step 2 of the plan: **Build the Info manual**.

This is accomplished by running the following shell command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make -C /Users/jay/emacs/emacs-fresh-source/doc/emacs info
#+END_SRC

After this command completes successfully, the next step will be to modify the user's Emacs configuration.
