#+TITLE: Handoff Message: Emacs Info Debugging Session
#+DATE: 2025-10-14

* Summary
The primary goal was to fix the Emacs Info system, which failed to find the "Calendar/Diary" documentation. The solution was to build the Emacs manual from source and create a custom function to access it directly, bypassing the broken Info directory system.

* Key Findings (The "Grand Unified Theory")
1.  The user's interactive Spacemacs environment aggressively mismanages `Info-directory-list`, making the standard Info directory system unreliable.
2.  The Homebrew-provided `emacs.info.gz` file is structured in a way that makes the `Calendar/Diary` node inaccessible via the directory system, even though a `Diary` node exists.
3.  A clean, minimal batch script *can* access the node, proving the underlying Emacs installation and Info files are not corrupt.
4.  Therefore, the problem is a conflict within the user's interactive configuration that breaks the standard Info lookup process.

* The Proven Solution (From User's Notes)
The user discovered notes from a previous machine that detail a successful solution to this exact problem. The strategy is to bypass the broken Info directory system entirely.

The plan was as follows:
1.  Clone the official GNU Emacs source code.
2.  Build the complete `emacs.info` manual from source using `make`.
3.  Modify the user's Emacs configuration to open this newly-built `emacs.info` file directly by its absolute path.

* Current Status
All steps of the plan are complete.
- The Emacs source code has been cloned to `/Users/jay/emacs/emacs-fresh-source/`.
- The `emacs.info` manual has been built.
- A custom function `jay-info-emacs-manual` has been created and bound to `M-h i`.

* IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP
The session is complete. The user should test the new keybinding `M-h i` to ensure it opens the custom Emacs manual.
