;;
;;  Documentation
;;  -------------
;;
;;  Library `zones.el' lets you easily define and subsequently act on
;;  multiple zones of buffer text.  You can think of this as enlarging
;;  the notion of "region".  In effect, it can remove the requirement
;;  of target text being a contiguous sequence of characters.  A set
;;  of buffer zones is, in effect, a (typically) noncontiguous
;;  "region" of text.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Compatibility")
;;  ** Compatibility **
;;
;;  Some of the functions defined here are not available for Emacs
;;  versions prior to Emacs 22.  Others are not available for versions
;;  prior to Emacs 23.  Still others are available only starting with
;;  Emacs 25.  This is mentioned where applicable.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Zones")
;;  ** Zones **
;;
;;  A "zone" is a basic zone or an izone.  A zone represents the text
;;  between its two positions, just as an Emacs region is the text
;;  between point and mark.
;;
;;  A "basic zone" is a list of two buffer positions followed by a
;;  possibly empty list of extra information: (POS1 POS2 . EXTRA).
;;
;;  An "izone" is a list whose first element is an identifier that is
;;  is a natural number (1, 2, 3,...)  and whose cdr is a basic zone:
;;  (ID POS1 POS2 . EXTRA).
;;
;;  The positions of a zone can be natural numbers (1, 2, 3,...),
;;  markers for the same buffer, or readable markers for the same
;;  buffer.  (Behavior is undefined if a zone has markers for
;;  different buffers.)  Each position of a given zone can take any of
;;  these forms.
;;
;;  A "readable marker" is a list (marker BUFFER POSITION), where
;;  BUFFER is a buffer name (string) and where POSITION is a buffer
;;  position (number only).
;;
;;  The positions of a zone can be in either numeric order.  The
;;  positions are also called the zone "limits".  The lower limit is
;;  called the zone "beginning"; the upper limit is called its "end".
;;
;;
;;(@* "Coalesced (United) Zones")
;;  ** Coalesced (United) Zones **
;;
;;  A list of zones can include zones that overlap or are adjacent
;;  (the end of one is one less than the beginning of the other).
;;
;;  Basic-zone union and intersection operations (`zz-zone-union',
;;  `zz-zone-intersection') each act on a list of zones, returning
;;  another such list, but which has POS1 <= POS2 in each of its
;;  zones, and which lists its zones in ascending order of their cars.
;;  For basic-zone union, the resulting zones are said to be
;;  "coalesced", or "united".
;;
;;  The extra info in the zones that result from zone union or
;;  intersection is just the set union or set intersection of the
;;  extra info in the zones that are combined.
;;
;;  After a list of zones has been altered by `zz-zone-union' or
;;  `zz-zone-intersection':
;;
;;  * Each zone in the result list is ordered so that its first
;;    element is smaller than its second.
;;
;;  * The zones in the result list have been sorted in ascending order
;;    by their first elements.
;;
;;  * The zones in the result list are not adjacent and do not
;;    overlap: there is some other buffer text (i.e., not in any zone)
;;    between any two zones in the result.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Zones and Overlays")
;;  ** Zones and Overlays **
;;
;;  Emacs overlays have a lot in common with zones: overlays have an
;;  associated buffer, two limits (positions), and a list of
;;  properties.  You can create zones from overlays, and vice versa,
;;  using functions `zz-overlay-to-zone', `zz-zone-to-overlay',
;;  `zz-overlays-to-zones', and `zz-zones-to-overlays'.
;;
;;  When creating zones from overlays you can specify how to represent
;;  the zone limits: using markers, readable markers, or positive
;;  integers.  And you can specify whether to create basic zones or
;;  izones.  The overlay property list becomes the EXTRA information
;;  of the resulting zone: (LIMIT1 LIMIT2 . EXTRA).
;;
;;  When creating overlays from zones, any list of EXTRA zone
;;  information is used as the property list of the resulting overlay.
;;  When creating a single such overlay you can optionally specify
;;  additional overlay properties, as well as arguments FRONT-ADVANCE
;;  and REAR-ADVANCE for function `make-overlay'.
;;
;;  You can use function `zz-overlay-union' to coalesce overlays in a
;;  given buffer that overlap or are adjacent.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Izone Commands")
;;  ** Izone Commands **
;;
;;  Commands that manipulate lists of zones generally use izones,
;;  because they make use of the zone identifiers.
;;
;;  Things you can do with zones:
;;
;;  * Sort them.
;;
;;  * Unite (coalesce) adjacent or overlapping zones (which includes
;;    sorting them).
;;
;;  * Intersect them.
;;
;;  * Narrow the buffer to any of them.  Cycle among narrowings.  If
;;    you use library `icicles.el' then you can also navigate among
;;    them in any order, and using completion against BEG-END range
;;    names.
;;
;;  * Select any of them as the active region.  Cycle among regions.
;;
;;  * Search them (they are automatically coalesced first).  For this
;;    you need library `isearch-prop.el'.
;;
;;  * Make a set of zones or its complement (the anti-zones)
;;    invisible.  For this you also need library `isearch-prop.el'.
;;
;;  * Highlight and unhighlight them.  For this you need library
;;    `highlight.el' or library `facemenu+.el' (different kinds of
;;    highlighting).
;;
;;  * Add zones of highlighted text (overlay or text-property
;;    highlighting).  For this you need library `highlight.el'.
;;    (You can highlight many ways, including dragging the mouse.)
;;
;;  * Add the active region to a list of zones.
;;
;;  * Add the region to a list of zones, and then unite (coalesce) the
;;    zones.
;;
;;  * Delete an izone from a list of zones.
;;
;;  * Clone a zones variable to another one, so the clone has the same
;;    zones.
;;
;;  * Clone a zones variable and then unite the zones of the clone.
;;
;;  * Make an izone variable persistent, in a bookmark.  Use the
;;    bookmark to restore it in a subsequent Emacs session.  For this
;;    you need library `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;  * Query-replace over them (Emacs 25 and later).
;;
;;
;;(@* "Izone List Variables")
;;  ** Izone List Variables **
;;
;;  Commands that use izones generally use a variable that holds a
;;  list of them.  By default, this is the buffer-local variable
;;  `zz-izones'.  But such a variable can be buffer-local or global.
;;  If it is global then it can use markers and readable markers for
;;  different buffers.
;;
;;  The value of variable `zz-izones-var' is the variable currently
;;  being used by default for izone commands.  The default value is
;;  `zz-izones'.
;;
;;  You can have any number of izones variables, and they can be
;;  buffer-local or global variables.
;;
;;  You can use `C-x n v' (command `zz-set-izones-var') anytime to set
;;  `zz-izones-var' to a variable whose name you enter.  With a prefix
;;  argument, the variable is made automatically buffer-local.  Use
;;  `C-x n v' to switch among various zone variables for the current
;;  buffer (if buffer-local) or globally.
;;
;;  Sometimes another zone command prompts you for the izones variable
;;  to use, if you give it a prefix argument.  The particular prefix
;;  arg determines whether the variable, if not yet bound, is made
;;  buffer-local, and whether `zz-izones-var' is set to the variable
;;  symbol:
;;
;;   prefix arg         buffer-local   set `zz-izones-var'
;;   ----------         ------------   -------------------
;;    Plain `C-u'        yes            yes
;;    > 0 (e.g. `C-1')   yes            no
;;    = 0 (e.g. `C-0')   no             yes
;;    < 0 (e.g. `C--')   no             no
;;
;;  For example, `C-u C-x n a' (`zz-add-zone') prompts you for a
;;  different variable to use, in place of the current value of
;;  `zz-izones-var'.  The variable you enter is made buffer-local and
;;  it becomes the new default izones variable for the buffer; that
;;  is, `zz-izones-var' is set to the variable symbol.
;;
;;  As another example, suppose that `zz-izones-var' is `zz-izones',
;;  the default value and buffer-local by design.  If you then use
;;  `C-- C-x n s' and enter a variable name at the prompt, that
;;  variable is not made buffer-local, and `zz-izones-var' is not set
;;  to that variable.  The active region is pushed to the variable,
;;  but because `zz-izones-var' is unchanged, a subsequent `C-x n s'
;;  (no prefix arg) pushes to `zz-izones'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Keys")
;;  ** Keys **
;;
;;  Many of the commands that manipulate izones are bound on keymap
;;  `narrow-map'.  They are available on prefix key `C-x n', along
;;  with the narrowing/widening keys `C-x n d', `C-x n n', `C-x n p',
;;  and `C-x n w':
;;
;;  C-x n a   `zz-add-zone' - Add to current izones variable
;;  C-x n A   `zz-add-zone-and-unite' - Add izone, then unite izones
;;  C-x n c   `zz-clone-zones' - Clone zones from one var to another
;;  C-x n C   `zz-clone-and-unite-zones' - Clone then unite zones
;;  C-x n d   `narrow-to-defun'
;;  C-x n C-d `zz-delete-zone' - Delete an izone from current var
;;  C-x n h   `hlt-highlight-regions' - Highlight izones
;;  C-x n H   `hlt-highlight-regions-in-buffers' - in multiple buffers
;;  C-x n l   `zz-add-zones-from-highlighting' - Add highlighted areas
;;  C-x n L   `zz-set-zones-from-highlighting' - Set to highlighted
;;  C-x n n   `narrow-to-region'
;;  C-x n p   `narrow-to-page'
;;  C-x n r   `zz-select-region-repeat' - Cycle as active regions
;;  C-x n u   `zz-unite-zones' - Unite (coalesce) izones
;;  C-x n v   `zz-set-izones-var' - Set `zz-izones-var' to a variable
;;  C-x n w   `widen'
;;  C-x n x   `zz-narrow-repeat' - Cycle as buffer narrowings
;;
;;
;;(@* "Command `zz-narrow-repeat'")
;;  ** Command `zz-narrow-repeat' **
;;
;;  Library `zones.el' modifies commands `narrow-to-region',
;;  `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' (`C-x n n', `C-x n d',
;;  and `C-x n p') so that the current buffer restriction
;;  (narrowing) is added to the izone list the current buffer (by
;;  default, buffer-local variable `zz-izones').
;;
;;  You can then use `C-x n x' to cycle among previous buffer
;;  narrowings.  Repeating `x' repeats the action: `C-x n x x x x'
;;  etc.  Each time you hit `x' a different narrowing is made current.
;;  This gives you an easy way to browse your past narrowings.
;;
;;  If the izone variable is not buffer-local then `zz-narrow-repeat'
;;  can cycle among the narrowings in different buffers, switching the
;;  buffer accordingly.
;;
;;  Invoking `C-x n x' with a prefix argument changes the behavior
;;  as follows:
;;
;;  * A plain prefix arg (`C-u') widens the buffer completely.
;;
;;  * A zero numeric prefix arg (e.g `C-0') widens completely and
;;    resets (empties) the current izone variable.
;;
;;  * A numeric prefix arg N takes you directly to the abs(N)th
;;    previous buffer narrowing.  That is, it widens abs(N) times.
;;    Positive and negative args work the same, except that a negative
;;    arg also pops entries off the ring: it removes the ring entries
;;    from the most recent back through the (-)Nth one.
;;
;;  By default, `C-x n x' is bound to command `zz-narrow-repeat'.
;;  (For Emacs versions prior to 22 it is bound by default to
;;  `zz-narrow', which is a non-repeatable version.  Repeatability is
;;  not available before Emacs 22.)
;;
;;  The mode-line lighter `Narrow' is still used for the ordinary
;;  Emacs narrowing commands.  But for `zz-narrow-repeat' (`C-x n x')
;;  the current narrowing is indicated in the lighter by an
;;  identifying number: `Narrow-1', `Narrow-2', and so on.  `mouse-2'
;;  on the `Narrow' part still widens completely, but `mouse-2' on the
;;  `-NUM' part uses `zz-narrow-repeat' to cycle to the next
;;  narrowing.
;;
;;  If option `zz-narrowing-use-fringe-flag' is non-nil, which it is
;;  by default, then the face of the selected frame's fringe is set to
;;  `zz-fringe-for-narrowing' whenever the buffer is narrowed.  This
;;  shows you that the current buffer is narrowed even if the
;;  mode-line does not.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Define Your Own Commands")
;;  ** Define Your Own Commands **
;;
;;  Pretty much anything you can do with the Emacs region you can do
;;  with a set of zones (i.e., with a non-contiguous "region").  But
;;  existing Emacs commands that act on the region do not know about
;;  non-contiguous regions.  What you will need to do is define new
;;  commands that take these into account.
;;
;;  You can define your own commands that iterate over a list of
;;  izones in a given buffer, or over such lists in a set of buffers.
;;  Utility functions `zz-izone-limits', `zz-izone-limits-in-bufs',
;;  and `zz-read-bufs' can help with this.
;;
;;  As examples of such commands, if you use library `highlight.el'
;;  then you can use `C-x n h' (command `hlt-highlight-regions') to
;;  highlight the izones recorded for the current buffer.  You can use
;;  `C-x n H' (command `hlt-highlight-regions-in-buffers') to do the
;;  same across a set of buffers that you specify (or across all
;;  visible buffers).  If option `hlt-auto-faces-flag' is non-nil then
;;  each region gets a different face.  Otherwise, all of the regions
;;  are highlighted with the same face.  Complementary (unbound)
;;  commands `hlt-unhighlight-regions' and
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-regions-in-buffers' unhighlight.
;;
;;  Defining your own command can be simple or somewhat complex,
;;  depending on how the region is used in the code for the
;;  corresponding region-action Emacs command.  The definition of
;;  `hlt-highlight-regions' just calls existing function
;;  `hlt-highlight-region' once for each recorded region:
;;
;; (defun hlt-highlight-regions (&optional regions face msgp mousep
;;                                         buffers)
;;   "Apply `hlt-highlight-region' to regions in `zz-izones'."
;;   (interactive (list (zz-izone-limits) nil t current-prefix-arg))
;;   (dolist (start+end  regions)
;;     (hlt-highlight-region (nth 0 start+end) (nth 1 start+end)
;;                           face msgp mousep buffers)))
;;
;;  That's it - just iterate over `zz-izones' with a function that
;;  takes the region as an argument.  What `zones.el' offers in this
;;  regard is a way to easily define a set of buffer zones.

;;                Protect Emacs 20 from wide-n-highlight-lighter call with (boundp 'mode-line-modes).

;;     zz-izone-delete: Fixed free variable vAR (to VARIABLE).
;;     Bind C-x n r to zz-select-region, not zz-select-region-repeat, if < Emacs 22.
;; 2015/08/15 dadams

;;     Bind wide-n-select-region-repeat to C-x n r.

;;     wide-n: Use wide-n-restrictions-var, not wide-n-restrictions.
;;     wide-n-push, wide-n-delete:

;; 2010/04/26 dadams

;; 2010/04/24 dadams
;;     Added: wide-n-markerize.
;;     Use non-destructive operations (again, as initially).
;;       wide-n-restrictions: Use (all) cons as init value.
;;       wide-n, narrow-to-region: Don't initialize to (all).
;;       wide-n: Use append, not nconc.
;;       narrow-to-region: Use remove, not delete.
;;     wide-n: Use wide-n-markerize.

;;     Zero prefix arg now widens completely and empties ring.
;;     Negative prefix arg now pops the ring.
