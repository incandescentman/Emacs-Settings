* Instructions

Let's make sure that when we export from org to mdx, we make sure to always include the required frontmatter

these are all required:

title*: *title: Expected type `"string"`, received `"date"`
  excerpt*: *excerpt: Required
  Image*: *Image: Required
  ImageAlt*: *ImageAlt: Required

So. if the org source file doesn't have a title, add a title drawn from the top-level org heading in the org buffer being exported.

if there is no excerpt provided, use the first non-heading sentence of the buffer as the excerpt.
