Currently, the astro exporter looks for a line like this:

#+POSTS_FOLDER: /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/actions/src/content/blog

in order to know the destination folder for the mdx export

let's declare a variable (is that what you call it?) of known posts folders

e.g.
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/actions/src/content/blog
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/socraticai/src/data/posts

etc

Then, if the org source file does not specify a posts folder, we prompt the user to select one from the list. does that make sense?
