One feature doesn't work. clicking on a file+emacs:/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/openai-roam/logistics/20240426140707-directory.org type link

It is supposed to open it in a separate frame, then return focus to the main buffer. but nothing happens

I added some debugging to see what's going on, here's the output:
