here's the opening of my article guiding students to be more thoughtful about when and how they use AI:

Roy Lee is an undergrad at Columbia University. Or at least he was ---
before he got kicked out for cheating.

In a much discussed article in New York Magazine, Lee describes how he used
ChatGPT to write his essays instead of doing the work himself.

"I'd just dump the prompt into ChatGPT and hand in whatever it spat
out," Lee explains. "At the end, I'd put on the finishing touches. I'd
just insert 20 percent of my humanity, my voice, into it."

Why did Lee feel so comfortable offloading his coursework to ChatGPT? Because, Lee says, most college assignments are "not relevant." Rather, they're "hackable by AI."


^ can we use a more withering word than "comfortable" in this sentence?
