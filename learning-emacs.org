** How to execute several expressions in 'else' block?
You don't need progn for this, as this is already the default behaviour:

 (if COND THEN ELSE...)

 If COND yields non-nil, do THEN, else do ELSE...
 Returns the value of THEN or the value of the last of the ELSE's.
 THEN must be one expression, but ELSE... can be zero or more expressions.
 If COND yields nil, and there are no ELSE's, the value is nil.

You would, of course, use progn if you wished to evaluate multiple expressions in the THEN form.

** unless
(unless condition a b c)

Unless A, do B and C.

If A is not true, then do B and C.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[:digit:] a digit, same as [0-9]
[:alpha:] a letter (an alphabetic character)
 [:alnum:] a letter or adigit (an alphanumeric character ()
 [:upper:] a letter in uppercase
 [[:space:]]+ a whitespace character, as defined by the syntax table
[[:digit:]+] Any digit

#+END_EXAMPLE


'[:ascii:]'
This matches any ASCII character (codes 0â€“127).

'[:alnum:]'
This matches any letter or digit. (At present, for multibyte characters, it matches anything that has word syntax.)

'[:alpha:]'
This matches any letter. (At present, for multibyte characters, it matches anything that has word syntax.)

'[:blank:]'
This matches space and tab only.

'[:cntrl:]'
This matches any ASCII control character.

'[:digit:]'
This matches '0' through '9'. Thus, '[-+[:digit:]]' matches any digit, as well as '+' and '-'.

'[:graph:]'
This matches graphic characters---everything except ASCII control characters, space, and the delete character.

'[:lower:]'
This matches any lower-case letter, as determined by the current case table (see Case Tables). If case-fold-search is non-nil, this also matches any upper-case letter.

'[:multibyte:]'
This matches any multibyte character (see Text Representations).

'[:nonascii:]'
This matches any non-ASCII character.

'[:print:]'
This matches printing characters---everything except ASCII control characters and the delete character.

'[:punct:]'
This matches any punctuation character. (At present, for multibyte characters, it matches anything that has non-word syntax.)

'[:space:]'
This matches any character that has whitespace syntax (see Syntax Class Table).

'[:unibyte:]'
This matches any unibyte character (see Text Representations).

'[:upper:]'
This matches any upper-case letter, as determined by the current case table (see Case Tables). If case-fold-search is non-nil, this also matches any lower-case letter.

'[:word:]'
This matches any character that has word syntax (see Syntax Class Table).

'[:xdigit:]'
This matches the hexadecimal digits: '0' through '9', 'a' through 'f' and 'A' through 'F'.

* Special Characters in Regular Expressions

Here is a list of the characters that are special in a regular expression.

'.' (Period)
is a special character that matches any single character except a newline. Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like 'a.b', which matches any three-character string that begins with 'a' and ends with 'b'.

'*'
is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to match the preceding regular expression repetitively as many times as possible. Thus, 'o*' matches any number of 'o's (including no 'o's).

'*' always applies to the smallest possible preceding expression. Thus, 'fo*' has a repeating 'o', not a repeating 'fo'. It matches 'f', 'fo', 'foo', and so on.

The matcher processes a '*' construct by matching, immediately, as many repetitions as can be found. Then it continues with the rest of the pattern. If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some of the matches of the '*'-modified construct in the hope that that will make it possible to match the rest of the pattern. For example, in matching 'ca*ar' against the string 'caaar', the 'a*' first tries to match all three 'a's; but the rest of the pattern is 'ar' and there is only 'r' left to match, so this try fails. The next alternative is for 'a*' to match only two 'a's. With this choice, the rest of the regexp matches successfully.

Warning: Nested repetition operators can run for an indefinitely long time, if they lead to ambiguous matching. For example, trying to match the regular expression '\(x+y*\)*a' against the string 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxz' could take hours before it ultimately fails. Emacs must try each way of grouping the 'x's before concluding that none of them can work. Even worse, '\(x*\)*' can match the null string in infinitely many ways, so it causes an infinite loop. To avoid these problems, check nested repetitions carefully, to make sure that they do not cause combinatorial explosions in backtracking.

'+'
is a postfix operator, similar to '*' except that it must match the preceding expression at least once. So, for example, 'ca+r' matches the strings 'car' and 'caaaar' but not the string 'cr', whereas 'ca*r' matches all three strings.

'?'
is a postfix operator, similar to '*' except that it must match the preceding expression either once or not at all. For example, 'ca?r' matches 'car' or 'cr'; nothing else.

'*?', '+?', '??'
These are "non-greedy" variants of the operators '*', '+' and '?'. Where those operators match the largest possible substring (consistent with matching the entire containing expression), the non-greedy variants match the smallest possible substring (consistent with matching the entire containing expression).

For example, the regular expression 'c[ad]*a' when applied to the string 'cdaaada' matches the whole string; but the regular expression 'c[ad]*?a', applied to that same string, matches just 'cda'. (The smallest possible match here for '[ad]*?' that permits the whole expression to match is 'd'.)

'[ ... ]'
is a character alternative, which begins with '[' and is terminated by ']'. In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what this character alternative can match.

Thus, '[ad]' matches either one 'a' or one 'd', and '[ad]*' matches any string composed of just 'a's and 'd's (including the empty string). It follows that 'c[ad]*r' matches 'cr', 'car', 'cdr', 'caddaar', etc.

You can also include character ranges in a character alternative, by writing the starting and ending characters with a '-' between them. Thus, '[a-z]' matches any lower-case ASCII letter. Ranges may be intermixed freely with individual characters, as in '[a-z$%.]', which matches any lower case ASCII letter or '$', '%' or period.

If case-fold-search is non-nil, '[a-z]' also matches upper-case letters. Note that a range like '[a-z]' is not affected by the locale's collation sequence, it always represents a sequence in ASCII order.

Note also that the usual regexp special characters are not special inside a character alternative. A completely different set of characters is special inside character alternatives: ']', '-' and '^'.

To include a ']' in a character alternative, you must make it the first character. For example, '[]a]' matches ']' or 'a'. To include a '-', write '-' as the first or last character of the character alternative, or put it after a range. Thus, '[]-]' matches both ']' and '-'. (As explained below, you cannot use '\]' to include a ']' inside a character alternative, since '\' is not special there.)

To include '^' in a character alternative, put it anywhere but at the beginning.

If a range starts with a unibyte character c and ends with a multibyte character c2, the range is divided into two parts: one spans the unibyte characters 'c..?\377', the other the multibyte characters 'c1..c2', where c1 is the first character of the charset to which c2 belongs.

A character alternative can also specify named character classes (see Char Classes). This is a POSIX feature. For example, '[[:ascii:]]' matches any ASCII character. Using a character class is equivalent to mentioning each of the characters in that class; but the latter is not feasible in practice, since some classes include thousands of different characters.

'[^ ... ]'
'[^' begins a complemented character alternative. This matches any character except the ones specified. Thus, '[^a-z0-9A-Z]' matches all characters except letters and digits.

'^' is not special in a character alternative unless it is the first character. The character following the '^' is treated as if it were first (in other words, '-' and ']' are not special there).

A complemented character alternative can match a newline, unless newline is mentioned as one of the characters not to match. This is in contrast to the handling of regexps in programs such as grep.

You can specify named character classes, just like in character alternatives. For instance, '[^[:ascii:]]' matches any non-ASCII character. See Char Classes.

'^'
When matching a buffer, '^' matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a line in the text being matched (or the beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer). Otherwise it fails to match anything. Thus, '^foo' matches a 'foo' that occurs at the beginning of a line.

When matching a string instead of a buffer, '^' matches at the beginning of the string or after a newline character.

For historical compatibility reasons, '^' can be used only at the beginning of the regular expression, or after '\(', '\(?:' or '\|'.

'$'
is similar to '^' but matches only at the end of a line (or the end of the accessible portion of the buffer). Thus, 'x+$' matches a string of one 'x' or more at the end of a line.

When matching a string instead of a buffer, '$' matches at the end of the string or before a newline character.

For historical compatibility reasons, '$' can be used only at the end of the regular expression, or before '\)' or '\|'.

'\'
has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including '\'), and it introduces additional special constructs.

Because '\' quotes special characters, '\$' is a regular expression that matches only '$', and '\[' is a regular expression that matches only '[', and so on.

Note that '\' also has special meaning in the read syntax of Lisp strings (see String Type), and must be quoted with '\'. For example, the regular expression that matches the '\' character is '\\'. To write a Lisp string that contains the characters '\\', Lisp syntax requires you to quote each '\' with another '\'. Therefore, the read syntax for a regular expression matching '\' is "\\\\".

It would be cool if Emacs could automatically popup that list, formatted as nicely as in your package, either after a slight delay, or directly.

* conditionals
Next: Combining Conditions, Previous: Sequencing, Up: Control Structures [Contents][Index]

10.2 Conditionals

Conditional control structures choose among alternatives. Emacs Lisp has four conditional forms: if, which is much the same as in other languages; when and unless, which are variants of if; and cond, which is a generalized case statement.

Special Form: if condition then-form else-forms...
if chooses between the then-form and the else-forms based on the value of condition. If the evaluated condition is non-nil, then-form is evaluated and the result returned. Otherwise, the else-forms are evaluated in textual order, and the value of the last one is returned. (The else part of if is an example of an implicit progn. See Sequencing.)

If condition has the value nil, and no else-forms are given, if returns nil.

if is a special form because the branch that is not selected is never evaluated---it is ignored. Thus, in this example, true is not printed because print is never called:

(if nil
 (print 'true)
 'very-false)
â‡’ very-false
Macro: when condition then-forms...
This is a variant of if where there are no else-forms, and possibly several then-forms. In particular,

(when condition a b c)
is entirely equivalent to

(if condition (progn a b c) nil)
Macro: unless condition forms...
This is a variant of if where there is no then-form:

(unless condition a b c)
is entirely equivalent to

(if condition nil
 a b c)
Special Form: cond clause...
cond chooses among an arbitrary number of alternatives. Each clause in the cond must be a list. The CAR of this list is the condition; the remaining elements, if any, the body-forms. Thus, a clause looks like this:

(condition body-forms...)
cond tries the clauses in textual order, by evaluating the condition of each clause. If the value of condition is non-nil, the clause succeeds; then cond evaluates its body-forms, and returns the value of the last of body-forms. Any remaining clauses are ignored.

If the value of condition is nil, the clause fails, so the cond moves on to the following clause, trying its condition.

A clause may also look like this:

(condition)
Then, if condition is non-nil when tested, the cond form returns the value of condition.

If every condition evaluates to nil, so that every clause fails, cond returns nil.

The following example has four clauses, which test for the cases where the value of x is a number, string, buffer and symbol, respectively:

(cond ((numberp x) x)
  ((stringp x) x)
  ((bufferp x)
  (setq temporary-hack x) ; multiple body-forms
  (buffer-name x))  ; in one clause
  ((symbolp x) (symbol-value x)))
Often we want to execute the last clause whenever none of the previous clauses was successful. To do this, we use t as the condition of the last clause, like this: (t body-forms). The form t evaluates to t, which is never nil, so this clause never fails, provided the cond gets to it at all. For example:

(setq a 5)
(cond ((eq a 'hack) 'foo)
  (t "default"))
â‡’ "default"
This cond expression returns foo if the value of a is hack, and returns the string "default" otherwise.

Any conditional construct can be expressed with cond or with if. Therefore, the choice between them is a matter of style. For example:

(if a b c)
â‰¡
(cond (a b) (t c))

* escape the alias
I often have aliases for vi, ls, etc. but sometimes you want to escape the alias. Just add a back slash to the command in front:

Eg:

$ alias vi=vim
$ # To escape the alias for vi:
$ \vi # This doesn't open VIM
Cool, isn't it?

* beginning and ending words in regex lists

\' (or escaped \\') is a regular expression for a word's end. So


  "\\.t\\(ex\\|xt\\)\\'"

stands for all words which end in '.tex' or '.txt'.


A way to make recentf ignore some files is to add appropriate regexps to recentf-exclude list:

(add-to-list 'recentf-exclude "\\.windows\\'")
(add-to-list 'recentf-exclude "\\.revive\\'")

: "\\'" just marks the end of the string

Yah, try ~M-p~!

Thank you! M-p was indeed the magic button I did not know about. Experiment and emacswiki confirm that M-p gives the previous command in the minibuffer history---so by varying the number of "M-p"'s it is possible to edit the query, replacement string or both.---Alice Lesser May 2 '13 at 15:24


M-p brings back the minibuffer history for past invocations of the specific command you're executing. It can be any of a number of commands, not just query-replace. So using it with ido-find-file brings back only strings that were used with ido-find-file, etc. Even more magic!---Alan Oct 8

** C-r
I can also use C-r. It shows me all the entries in minibuffer and I can select from that. I have C-r binded to M-x anything-minibuffer-history. After M-x query-replace, hit C-h b and search for major-mode in the Help buffer. That will give full list of command. Here is my bindings.
