#+TITLE: Visual Design Philosophy

#+DESCRIPTION: Principles for typography, color, and visual behavior inside this Emacs configuration.

* Core Design Principles
- Favor high-contrast themes (`spacemacs-light`, custom `whiteboard`) for long-form writing.
- Cursor visibility matters; default to incarnadine red unless intentionally themed otherwise.
- Frame adjustments (width, transparency) support focused sessions and presentation modes.

* Color System and Usage Rules
- Primary theme palette derives from Spacemacs light variants; custom themes live under `jay-custom-color-themes/`.
- Cursor defaults to `red`; alternative accents (magenta) only for transient modes.
- Transparency utilities (`transparent-serenity`, `rainy-highway-mode`) must keep text legible against backgrounds â‰¥ 60% opacity.

* Typography Hierarchy
- Font switchers expose curated faces: `georgia-font` for prose, `jetbrains-font`/`hack-font` for code, `large-type` for readability.
- Maintain frame width harmony (`set-frame-width` inside font helpers) so wrapping remains predictable in Org buffers.
- Use `set-font-size` for ad hoc adjustments instead of manual `M-x set-face-attribute` to keep frames consistent.

* Component Patterns
- Hydras and pop-ups should inherit default fonts; avoid per-hydra font overrides.
- Tables rely on monospaced faces; ensure `org-table` face tracks the current default font.

* Interactive Behaviors
- Transparency toggles must restore cursor color via `incarnadine-cursor`.
- Theme-switching commands should call `load-theme` and immediately reapply cursor settings.

* View-Specific Guidance
- Presentation/reading mode: call `large-type` + `whiteboard` + optional `transparent-serenity`.
- Coding sessions: `jetbrains-font` or `hack-font` paired with `spacemacs-light` keeps alignment crisp.

* Evolution Principles
- When adding a new theme, document it here, include rationale, and ensure fallback to `incarnadine-cursor`.
- Prefer adding new font helpers in `fonts-and-themes.el` rather than ad hoc `set-face-attribute` snippets scattered elsewhere.
