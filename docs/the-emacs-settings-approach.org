#+TITLE: The Emacs Settings Approach
#+DATE: 2025-10-26
#+DESCRIPTION: Philosophy and guiding principles behind this Emacs configuration

* Overview

This document explains the *why* behind this configuration—the philosophy, values, and design principles that guide decision-making when extending or modifying the system.

* Background and Motivation

** The Problem

Most Emacs configurations fall into one of these categories:

1. *Minimal configs*: Fast but bare-bones, require constant tweaking
2. *Mega-distributions* (Doom, Spacemacs): Feature-rich but opaque, hard to customize
3. *Personal configs*: Highly customized but poorly documented, hard to understand later

** This Approach

This configuration aims for a *different balance*:

- *Foundation*: Spacemacs provides structure and packages
- *Customization*: Deep, documented customizations for specific workflows
- *Documentation*: Literate programming keeps explanations with code
- *Focus*: Writing, note-taking, and knowledge management (not general coding)

** Evolution

This config has evolved over 10+ years:
- Started with vanilla Emacs
- Moved to Spacemacs for better defaults
- Added deep org-mode customizations
- Built sophisticated clipboard integration
- Created org-roam profile system
- Accumulated 300+ custom functions

The result: A highly personalized environment that "just works" for specific workflows.

* Core Philosophy

** 1. Writing First, Coding Second

*Principle*: This is primarily a *writing environment*, not a development environment.

*Implications*:
- Typography matters (beautiful fonts, themes, spacing)
- Clipboard integration is crucial (copy from web → Emacs)
- Org-mode is central (outlining, structure, publishing)
- Formatting is automatic (smart quotes, proper dashes, clean spacing)

*Examples*:
- Pasteboard functions auto-clean web content
- Multiple beautiful themes (whiteboard, matrix, etc.)
- Org-roam for interconnected notes
- Export to multiple formats (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown)

** 2. Literate Programming

*Principle*: Code and documentation should live together.

*Why*:
- Future-you needs to understand past-you's decisions
- Complex logic needs explanation
- Examples make functions clearer
- Beautiful exports to HTML/PDF for sharing

*How*:
- Major files are =.org= files with code blocks
- Press =C-c C-v t= to tangle (extract code)
- Documentation stays in sync with implementation
- Git history shows why, not just what

*Example structure*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,* Clipboard Cleaning
This section handles text from web browsers.

,** Why This Is Needed
Web content has curly quotes, smart dashes, and weird
whitespace that looks bad in plain text.

,** Implementation
,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun pasteboard-paste-clean ()
  "Clean and paste clipboard content."
  ...)
,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 3. macOS Integration

*Principle*: Deep platform integration enhances workflow.

*Why macOS-specific?*
- Uses macOS daily for everything
- Clipboard integration is critical
- System keybindings should match
- Integration with Finder, Spotlight, etc.

*Features*:
- =pbpaste=/=pbcopy= for clipboard access
- Command key (=⌘=) mapped to =s-= in Emacs
- AppleScript integration for system automation
- Finder integration (reveal file, open terminal, etc.)

*Tradeoff*: Less portable, but much more useful on primary platform.

** 4. Org-Mode Centrality

*Principle*: Org-mode is the canonical format for everything.

*What lives in org-mode*:
- Notes (via org-roam)
- Tasks and todos
- Documentation (including this file!)
- Code (literate programming)
- Journal entries
- Meeting notes
- Planning documents
- Knowledge base

*Why org-mode?*
- Plain text (future-proof, git-friendly)
- Structured (headings, lists, tables)
- Extensible (org-roam, org-export, etc.)
- Powerful (queries, agenda, capture)
- Export to anything (HTML, PDF, Markdown, etc.)

** 5. Single Source of Truth

*Principle*: Avoid duplicate code and documentation.

*Implementation*:
- =shared-functions.org= contains most utilities
- Single clipboard module (not scattered functions)
- Org-roam profiles (not separate configs)
- Central documentation directory (=docs/=)

*Why*:
- Prevents drift (two versions of same function)
- Makes searching easier (one place to look)
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Clear dependencies

*Tradeoff*: Large files (=shared-functions.org= is 10k lines), but worth it.

** 6. Convenience Over Purity

*Principle*: Pragmatism beats elegance if it actually works better.

*Examples*:
- One large file instead of dozens of small modules
- Some copy-pasted code when abstraction is harder to read
- Hardcoded paths when variables would be overkill
- Mixed indentation styles (tabs where inherited, spaces where new)

*Why*:
- This is a personal config, not a library
- Maintenance is easier when things are obvious
- Premature abstraction is a real problem
- "Good enough" beats "perfect but unfinished"

*When to change*: When duplication causes actual problems, not theoretical ones.

** 7. Adaptive Behavior

*Principle*: Functions should detect context and do the right thing.

*Examples*:

| Function                       | Adaptive Behavior                                  |
|--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| =pasteboard-paste-adaptive=    | Cleans in org buffers, raw in code buffers         |
| =smart-return=                 | Different behavior in org vs. markdown vs. code    |
| =jay/increase-font-size=       | Adjusts by appropriate amount for current size     |
| =org-roam-capture-adaptive=    | Templates based on current profile                 |

*Why*:
- Fewer commands to remember
- Less context switching
- More "it just works" moments
- Reduces cognitive load

*Implementation*:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun pasteboard-paste-adaptive ()
  (interactive)
  (if (derived-mode-p 'org-mode 'text-mode)
      (pasteboard-paste-clean)   ; Clean for writing
    (pasteboard-paste-verbatim))) ; Raw for code
#+END_SRC

** 8. Progressive Enhancement

*Principle*: Core functionality works simply, enhancements are optional.

*Layers*:
1. *Base*: Spacemacs provides solid defaults
2. *Essential*: Org-mode, clipboard, basic keybindings
3. *Enhanced*: Org-roam, themes, advanced formatting
4. *Experimental*: New features being tested

*Why*:
- Can fall back to simpler version if something breaks
- Easy to debug (disable layers progressively)
- Optional dependencies (config works without org-roam, but better with it)

*Example*: Clipboard
- Level 1: Regular paste (=C-y=)
- Level 2: Pasteboard paste (=Cmd-v=, raw system clipboard)
- Level 3: Adaptive paste (auto-cleans based on context)
- Level 4: Smart heading adjustment (fixes heading levels when pasting)

* Design Values

** Predictability

*What*: Similar inputs should produce similar outputs.

*How*:
- Consistent keybindings (Spacemacs helps)
- Clear function naming (=jay/...= for interactive, =pasteboard-...= for clipboard)
- Documented behavior (docstrings and literate programming)
- Minimal "magic" (explicit over implicit)

*Example*: All clipboard functions start with =pasteboard-=, all user commands start with =jay/=.

** Discoverability

*What*: Should be easy to find and learn features.

*How*:
- Spacemacs keybinding menus (=SPC= shows options)
- =C-h f= / =C-h k= to describe functions/keys
- Documentation in =docs/= directory
- Examples in literate org files
- Hydras for grouped commands

*Example*: Press =SPC= and see a menu of options, press =f= to see file commands, press =e= to see Emacs commands, etc.

** Maintainability

*What*: Should be easy to update and fix years later.

*How*:
- Git history with good commit messages
- =work-log.org= documents changes
- =codebase-wisdom.org= captures lessons learned
- Literate programming explains decisions
- Clear file organization

*Example*: When debugging a 2-year-old function, the org file has surrounding context explaining why it works that way.

** Reliability

*What*: Core workflows should just work, always.

*How*:
- Conservative with updates (don't blindly upgrade)
- Test before committing
- Git branches for experiments
- Backup system (git + Dropbox + Time Machine)
- Error handling in critical functions

*Example*: Clipboard functions have fallbacks if =pbpaste= fails.

* Guiding Principles in Practice

** When Adding a Feature

Ask:
1. *Does it fit the workflow?* (Writing/note-taking focus)
2. *Where does it belong?* (Which module/file)
3. *How do I document it?* (Literate org file or docstring)
4. *Is it maintainable?* (Will I understand it in 2 years?)
5. *What breaks if it fails?* (Error handling needed?)

** When Fixing a Bug

Process:
1. Document the bug (what broke, why)
2. Find root cause (don't just patch symptoms)
3. Fix in source (=.org= file, not tangled =.el=)
4. Test thoroughly
5. Update =work-log.org=
6. Add to =codebase-wisdom.org= if non-obvious
7. Commit with clear message

** When Cleaning Up

Priorities:
1. Fix breaking changes (deprecated functions, APIs)
2. Improve documentation (unclear functions)
3. Remove dead code (commented-out functions)
4. Standardize inconsistencies (if easy)
5. Performance optimization (if it matters)

*Don't*:
- Refactor working code just for aesthetics
- Standardize everything at once (incremental improvement)
- Abstract before you understand the pattern
- Optimize prematurely

* Key Terminology

** Configuration Terms

- *Spacemacs*: Emacs distribution with curated packages and keybindings
- *Layer*: Spacemacs package bundle (e.g., org layer includes org-mode + related packages)
- *Literate programming*: Code with extensive documentation in same file
- *Tangle*: Extract code blocks from org file → elisp file
- *Byte-compile*: Compile =.el= → =.elc= for faster loading

** Custom Terms

- *Pasteboard*: macOS system clipboard and integration functions
- *Adaptive function*: Function that changes behavior based on context
- *Profile* (org-roam): Independent note database (work vs. personal)
- =jay/...=: Prefix for interactive user commands
- *Hydra*: Modal keybinding menu (multiple commands under one prefix)

** File Types

- =.org= file: Literate programming source (documentation + code blocks)
- =.el= file: Emacs Lisp source (tangled from =.org= or standalone)
- =.elc= file: Byte-compiled elisp (generated from =.el=, faster loading)
- =init.el=: Main Spacemacs configuration (symlinked to =~/.spacemacs=)

* Common Workflows

** Thought Process: Adding a Function

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. What problem am I solving?
   → Pasting from web has ugly formatting

2. Where does this belong?
   → Clipboard-related, so pasteboard-copy-and-paste-functions.org

3. What should it do?
   → Fix smart quotes, normalize dashes, clean whitespace

4. What should it be called?
   → pasteboard-paste-clean (clear, matches module)

5. What's the interface?
   → Interactive command, bound to Cmd-v

6. How do I document it?
   → Literate org: explanation + code + examples

7. How do I test it?
   → Copy messy text, paste, verify it's clean

8. What if it fails?
   → Fall back to regular paste, show error message
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Thought Process: Debugging an Issue

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. What's the symptom?
   → "void-function" error when pasting

2. What changed recently?
   → Updated Spacemacs yesterday

3. What's the error message?
   → "void-function key-minor-mode-map"

4. Where is that defined?
   → jay-osx.el

5. Is it loading?
   → Check *Messages* buffer → No mention of jay-osx.el

6. Why isn't it loading?
   → Check init.el loading order → Missing from load-path

7. How do I fix it?
   → Add to load-path or move earlier in loading sequence

8. Did it work?
   → Restart Emacs, test paste → Success!

9. How do I prevent this?
   → Add comment explaining load order dependency
   → Document in codebase-wisdom.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Anti-Patterns to Avoid

** Don't

1. *Edit tangled =.el= files directly*
   - Changes will be lost next time you tangle
   - Edit the =.org= source instead

2. *Blindly update packages*
   - Spacemacs updates can break things
   - Test in a branch first, check for errors

3. *Add features "because they're cool"*
   - Only add what you'll actually use
   - Unused features are maintenance burden

4. *Abstract too early*
   - Need 3+ similar uses before abstracting
   - Duplication is sometimes clearer

5. *Forget to document*
   - Future-you will curse present-you
   - Write the explanation while it's fresh

6. *Ignore deprecation warnings*
   - They'll break eventually
   - Fix them when you see them

** Do

1. *Commit frequently with good messages*
   - Easy to revert bad changes
   - History explains decisions

2. *Test in isolation first*
   - New function in scratch buffer before adding to config
   - Verify it works before binding to keys

3. *Keep functions focused*
   - One function, one job
   - Compose simple functions into complex workflows

4. *Document non-obvious choices*
   - Why this approach and not that one?
   - What did you try that didn't work?

5. *Update documentation with code*
   - Change function → update docstring
   - Fix bug → update work-log.org

* Design Tensions and Tradeoffs

** Simplicity vs. Power

*Tension*: Simple functions are easy to understand, powerful functions do more.

*Resolution*: Build layers
- Simple functions do one thing
- Convenience functions combine them
- Adaptive functions choose automatically

*Example*:
- =pasteboard-paste-verbatim= (simple: paste raw)
- =pasteboard-paste-clean= (powerful: clean then paste)
- =pasteboard-paste-adaptive= (smart: choose based on context)

** Portability vs. Integration

*Tension*: macOS-specific code isn't portable, but integration is valuable.

*Resolution*: Isolate platform-specific code
- =jay-osx.el= for macOS-specific features
- =shared-functions.org= for cross-platform utilities
- Conditional loading: =(when (eq system-type 'darwin) ...)=

*Choice*: Optimize for primary platform (macOS), accept it won't work elsewhere.

** Documentation vs. Brevity

*Tension*: Verbose documentation is harder to read, terse code is harder to understand.

*Resolution*: Literate programming
- Org files can be verbose (narrative explanation)
- Code blocks are focused (just the implementation)
- Docstrings are concise (one-line summary + details)

*Rule of thumb*: Public functions get full treatment, internal helpers get docstrings.

** Speed vs. Features

*Tension*: More features means slower startup, but features are useful.

*Resolution*: Deferred loading
- Core features load immediately (org, clipboard)
- Nice-to-haves load on-demand (themes, experimental features)
- Byte-compile everything (faster loading)

*Current*: ~5-8 second startup (acceptable for daily-use environment).

** Consistency vs. Pragmatism

*Tension*: Consistent style is nice, but forcing it everywhere is busywork.

*Resolution*: Consistency where it matters
- Function naming: Consistent (=jay/...=, =pasteboard-...=)
- Keybindings: Consistent (Spacemacs conventions)
- Indentation: Mixed (fix gradually, not all at once)

*Philosophy*: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" (in that order).

* Future Direction

See =critical-next-steps.org= for specific tasks, but philosophically:

** Continue Focusing On

- Writing and note-taking workflows
- Org-mode and org-roam enhancements
- Clipboard and formatting improvements
- Beautiful, distraction-free writing environment
- Deep macOS integration

** Consider Adding

- More org-roam automation (templates, linking, review)
- Better mobile sync (org files to phone)
- Export templates (beautiful PDFs, blog posts)
- Search and navigation improvements
- AI integration (GPT for writing assistance)

** Avoid

- Turning this into a development IDE
- Supporting multiple platforms (stay focused on macOS)
- Chasing every new Emacs package
- Breaking working features for aesthetic consistency
- Over-abstracting simple code

* Conclusion

This configuration reflects a specific set of values:

1. *Writing-first*: Optimized for prose, not code
2. *Documented*: Literate programming and extensive docs
3. *Integrated*: Deep macOS clipboard integration
4. *Org-centric*: Everything goes in org-mode
5. *Pragmatic*: Working beats perfect

It's not for everyone, but it's highly optimized for this particular workflow. The extensive documentation ensures it remains understandable and maintainable years later.

When in doubt, ask: "Does this help me write better, take better notes, and manage knowledge more effectively?" If yes, it probably fits. If no, it probably doesn't belong here.
