#+TITLE: Org-Roam Profile Switching - Quick Start
#+DATE: 2025-10-19

* What Are Profiles?

Profiles let you maintain *completely separate* org-roam databases. Think of them as different notebooks:
- **Work notebook** (default profile): For professional notes, AI research, job hunting, etc.
- **Personal notebook** (my-life profile): For journaling, gratitude, health tracking, family notes, etc.

Each profile has its own:
- Directory (where .org files live)
- Database (where links and metadata are stored)
- Capture templates (what shows up when you create a new note)

*They never mix.* When you're in the work profile, you only see work notes. When you're in personal, you only see personal notes.

* Quick Reference

** Switch Profiles
| Command | What It Does |
|---------+--------------|
| =s-u 1= | Switch to work (default) profile |
| =s-u 2= | Switch to personal (my-life) profile |
| =s-u P= | Interactive switch (choose from menu) |
| =s-u C-p= | Show which profile you're currently in |

** Mode Line
Look at your mode line (bottom of Emacs). You'll see:
- =[Roam:Default]= - You're in work mode
- =[Roam:My]= - You're in personal mode

*Pro tip:* Click on the mode-line indicator to switch profiles!

* Common Workflows

** Morning Routine (Personal Time)
1. Start Emacs or press =s-u 2= to switch to personal
2. Mode line shows =[Roam:My]=
3. Press =s-:= to open today's journal
4. Capture templates now show personal options:
   - =j= - journal entry
   - =g= - gratitude note
   - =r= - reflection
   - =h= - health & wellness
   - =f= - family note
   - =m= - memory/experience

** Work Time
1. Press =s-u 1= to switch to work
2. Mode line shows =[Roam:Default]=
3. Use =s-u f= to find or create work notes
4. Capture templates now show work options:
   - =A= - accountability/task
   - =g= - ChatGPT outputs
   - =I= - AI intelligence notes
   - =M= - job hunt momentum
   - =p= - person (professional contact)
   - =S= - Socratic AI
   - Plus 20+ other work templates

** End of Day (Switch Back to Personal)
1. Press =s-u 2=
2. Write evening reflections or gratitude
3. Profile automatically saves - tomorrow it'll remember you were in personal mode

* What Happens When You Switch?

Behind the scenes:
1. ✅ Current database connection safely closes
2. ✅ Directory changes to new profile's location
3. ✅ Capture templates swap out
4. ✅ New database opens and syncs
5. ✅ Your choice is saved to =~/.cache/org-roam-current-profile=
6. ✅ Mode line updates to show new profile
7. ✅ Message confirms: "Switched to org-roam profile: my-life (My Life)"

* Your Two Profiles

** Default (Work)
- *Location:* =~/Dropbox/roam/=
- *Database:* Auto-managed in =~/.cache/=
- *Templates:* Full professional template suite
- *Use for:* Work notes, AI research, job hunting, professional contacts, quotes, writing

** My-Life (Personal)
- *Location:* =~/Dropbox/roam-life/=
- *Database:* =~/Dropbox/roam-life/.org-roam.db= (self-contained)
- *Templates:* Life-focused templates
- *Use for:* Personal journaling, gratitude, health, family, memories, personal ideas

* Tips & Best Practices

** Muscle Memory
Train yourself:
- Work day starts? =s-u 1=
- Personal time? =s-u 2=
- Unsure which you're in? =s-u C-p=

** Check Before Capturing
Always glance at the mode line before creating a new note. You don't want to accidentally create personal notes in your work database (or vice versa).

** No Cross-References
Because profiles are independent, you can't link from a work note to a personal note. This is by design - it keeps work and life separate.

If you need to reference something across profiles, copy the content or use plain text references.

** Backup Both
Since you have two separate directories, make sure both are backed up:
- =~/Dropbox/roam/= (work)
- =~/Dropbox/roam-life/= (personal)

If you use Dropbox (as configured), both are already synced.

* Troubleshooting

** "Which profile am I in?"
Press =s-u C-p= to see:
#+begin_example
Current profile: my-life (My Life)
Directory: /Users/jay/Dropbox/roam-life
Database: /Users/jay/Dropbox/roam-life/.org-roam.db
#+end_example

** "I don't see my personal templates"
You're probably still in the work profile. Press =s-u 2= to switch to personal.

** "Mode line doesn't show profile"
The mode-line indicator is at the very end of the mode line. Look for =[Roam:...]= in cyan.

** "Profile didn't save"
Profiles save automatically to =~/.cache/org-roam-current-profile=. Check that file exists and is writable.

** "Can I add a third profile?"
Yes! See =docs/ORG-ROAM-PROFILES-README.md= for instructions on adding custom profiles.
