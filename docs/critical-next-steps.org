#+TITLE: Critical Next Steps
#+DATE: 2025-09-24
#+DESCRIPTION: Active technical debt and improvement roadmap.

* Active Improvements
** Harden Pasteboard Regression Tests
- Why it matters: Sanitizer regressions escape easily; tables and emoji already bit us.
- Scope remaining: Create automated fixtures (ERT or batch scripts) that run `pasteboard-paste-clean` against representative inputs.
- Recommended plan: 1) Collect sample inputs under `test-fixtures/`. 2) Write batch Emacs script exercising cleaners. 3) Add to CI or pre-push hook.
- Status: Not started.

** OPTIONAL Document Hydras and Keymaps
- Why it matters: Even solo usage benefits from a future-you reference when returning after a break.
- Scope remaining: Inventory hydras in `hydras.org`, surface keybinding cheatsheet in `/docs/instructions.org`.
- Recommended plan: (Optional) 1) Generate listing via `rg "defhydra"`. 2) Summarize purpose + entry chord. 3) Link from instructions.
- Status: Deferred (solo user).

* Stretch Goals
- Port critical helpers to packaged modules for easier reuse across machines.
- Introduce automated linting (e.g., `checkdoc`, `package-lint`) before committing large refactors.
