#+TITLE: Critical Next Steps
#+DATE: 2025-10-26
#+DESCRIPTION: Technical debt, improvements, and future roadmap

* Overview

This document tracks:
- Active technical debt that should be addressed
- Planned improvements and why they matter
- Stretch goals for future consideration
- Things explicitly NOT being pursued (and why)

Status indicators:
- *[ACTIVE]* - Currently important, should address soon
- *[PLANNED]* - Scoped and ready to implement
- *[OPTIONAL]* - Would be nice, but not critical
- *[TABLED]* - Decided not to pursue (for now)

* High Priority (Active)

** [ACTIVE] Harden Pasteboard Regression Tests

*Why it matters*:
- Sanitizer regressions have bitten us multiple times (tables, emoji, headings)
- Manual testing is time-consuming and error-prone
- Don't catch issues until they hit production use

*Current state*:
- No automated tests
- Rely on manual smoke tests
- Regressions escape easily

*Proposal*:
1. Create =test-fixtures/= directory with sample inputs:
   - =markdown-with-tables.txt=
   - =emoji-compound.txt=
   - =mixed-markdown-org.txt=
   - =github-flavored-markdown.txt=
   - =chatgpt-output.txt=

2. Write batch Emacs script that:
   - Loads pasteboard functions
   - Runs =pasteboard--clean-string= on each fixture
   - Compares output to expected result
   - Reports differences

3. Add to git pre-commit hook or CI

*Example test*:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; test-pasteboard.el
(require 'ert)
(load-file "pasteboard-copy-and-paste-functions.el")

(ert-deftest test-markdown-table-separators ()
  "Table separators should be preserved"
  (let ((input "| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |")
        (expected "| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |"))
    (should (string= (pasteboard--clean-string input) expected))))
#+END_SRC

*Next steps*:
1. Collect problematic inputs from past bugs (see =codebase-wisdom.org=)
2. Create expected outputs
3. Write test harness
4. Run before each release

*Effort*: ~4-6 hours initial setup, ~30 minutes per new test

*Status*: Not started

** [PLANNED] Document Function Dependencies

*Why it matters*:
- Some functions depend on others being loaded first
- Loading order bugs are hard to debug
- New users (or future-you) don't know what depends on what

*Current problem*:
- =key-minor-mode-map= must load before functions that use it
- =shared-functions.el= must load before modules that call its functions
- Dependencies are implicit (no documentation)

*Proposal*:
Add dependency comments at top of each major file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; pasteboard-copy-and-paste-functions.el --- Clipboard integration
;;
;; Dependencies:
;;   - shared-functions.el (required)
;;   - jay-osx.el (optional, for key-minor-mode-map)
;;   - External: pbcopy, pbpaste (macOS command-line tools)
;;
;; Must load AFTER: shared-functions.el
;; Must load BEFORE: (none)
#+END_SRC

*Next steps*:
1. Map out actual dependencies (draw a graph if needed)
2. Add comments to each file
3. Update loading sequence documentation in =design-architecture.org=
4. Consider adding =(require)= statements to make dependencies explicit

*Effort*: ~2-3 hours

*Status*: Planned, not started

** [OPTIONAL] Standardize Function Naming

*Why it matters*:
- Easier to find related functions
- Clearer what's user-facing vs. internal
- Reduces naming collisions

*Current state*:
- Mix of prefixes: =jay/...=, =my-...=, =pasteboard-...=, =org-...=
- Some consistency, but not enforced
- Internal helpers have various naming patterns

*Proposed conventions*:
| Prefix           | Usage                                  | Example                    |
|------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------|
| =jay/=           | User-facing interactive commands       | =jay/delete-and-capitalize= |
| =pasteboard-=    | Public clipboard functions             | =pasteboard-paste-clean=   |
| =pasteboard--=   | Internal clipboard helpers (2 dashes)  | =pasteboard--clean-string= |
| =org-...=        | Org-mode specific                      | =org-roam-capture=         |
| =my-=            | Generic utilities (refactor to =jay/=) | =my-org-files-list=        |

*Double-dash convention*: Internal/private functions use =--= (Emacs convention)

*Next steps*:
1. Inventory all function names (=rg "defun"=)
2. Categorize as public vs. internal
3. Rename in batches (use =replace-all= parameter in Edit tool)
4. Test thoroughly (breaking change!)

*Effort*: ~6-8 hours (need to update all call sites)

*Status*: Optional (working fine as-is, but would be cleaner)

* Medium Priority (Planned)

** [PLANNED] Add Deprecation Tracking

*Why it matters*:
- Emacs and Org-mode deprecate functions regularly
- Warnings accumulate
- Eventually things break

*Current state*:
- Fix deprecations when noticed
- No systematic tracking
- Some known but unfixed (documented in CLAUDE.md)

*Proposal*:
1. Create =docs/deprecations.org=:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Active Deprecation Warnings
   ** org-bracket-link-regexp → org-link-bracket-re
   Status: FIXED (2025-09-05)

   ** shift-select-mode
   Status: FIXED (2025-10-06)

   ** TODO: cl-return vs return
   Status: TODO - Low priority, still works
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Run =emacs --batch --eval "(byte-compile-file \"file.el\")"= to find warnings

3. Track in deprecations.org with priority

4. Fix high-priority before each major Emacs/Spacemacs upgrade

*Next steps*:
1. Byte-compile all files, capture warnings
2. Create deprecations.org
3. Prioritize by impact
4. Fix critical ones first

*Effort*: ~3-4 hours initial, ~1 hour per major update

*Status*: Planned

** [OPTIONAL] Profile Startup Time

*Why it matters*:
- Startup is ~5-8 seconds (acceptable but could be better)
- Don't know where time is spent
- Optimization is guesswork

*Current state*:
- No profiling data
- Assumed slow areas: large files, many packages
- Some deferred loading, but not systematic

*Proposal*:
1. Run Emacs with profiling:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   emacs --debug-init --timed-requires
   #+END_SRC

2. Identify slowest loads

3. Consider:
   - More aggressive deferred loading
   - Lazy autoloads
   - Moving non-essential config to separate file
   - Byte-compilation verification

4. Document findings in =performance.org=

*Next steps*:
1. Profile current startup
2. Identify top 5 slowest items
3. Estimate potential gains
4. Decide if worth optimizing (maybe it's fine!)

*Effort*: ~2-3 hours investigation, varies for fixes

*Status*: Optional (startup is acceptable, optimization is premature)

** [OPTIONAL] Document All Hydras

*Why it matters*:
- Hydras provide quick access to commands
- Forget what's available after time away
- No central reference

*Current state*:
- Hydras defined in =hydras.org= and tangled to =hydras.el=
- No documentation beyond code
- Need to read code to discover available hydras

*Proposal*:
1. Generate hydra inventory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ~/emacs/emacs-settings
   rg "defhydra" hydras.org
   #+END_SRC

2. Document in =instructions.org= or separate =hydras-reference.org=:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Available Hydras
   ** Window Management (=SPC w=)
   - =w= - Split window
   - =d= - Delete window
   - ...

   ** Font Adjustment (=F8=)
   - =j= - Increase size
   - =k= - Decrease size
   - ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. Add cheat sheet

*Next steps*:
1. List all hydras
2. Document purpose and entry keybinding
3. List available options in each
4. Add examples

*Effort*: ~2-3 hours

*Status*: Optional, tabled (solo user, low priority)

* Stretch Goals (Future)

** [IDEA] Package Critical Helpers as Reusable Modules

*Why*:
- Share useful functions across machines
- Contribute back to community
- Force cleaner interfaces

*What to package*:
- Pasteboard integration (as =pasteboard-mode=)
- Smart capitalization functions
- Org-roam profile switching (as =org-roam-profiles=)

*Steps*:
1. Extract to separate repo
2. Add package metadata
3. Write README
4. Publish to MELPA (optional)
5. Use as dependency in main config

*Effort*: Significant (~10-20 hours per package)

*Status*: Stretch goal, low priority

** [IDEA] Automated Linting

*Why*:
- Catch errors before runtime
- Enforce consistent style
- Reduce bugs

*Tools to consider*:
- =checkdoc= - Documentation string checker
- =package-lint= - Package metadata checker
- =elisp-lint= - General linting
- =relint= - Regexp linter

*Implementation*:
1. Add to pre-commit hook
2. Fix existing warnings
3. Enforce going forward

*Effort*: ~6-8 hours setup, ongoing maintenance

*Status*: Stretch goal

** [IDEA] Mobile Integration

*Why*:
- Access notes on phone
- Capture ideas on the go
- Sync org-roam to mobile

*Options to explore*:
- Orgzly (Android org-mode app)
- beorg (iOS org-mode app)
- Dropbox sync (already in place)
- Org-roam mobile setup

*Challenges*:
- Org-roam database sync
- Two-way sync conflicts
- Mobile UI limitations

*Effort*: Significant (~15-20 hours research + setup)

*Status*: Interesting but not urgent

* Explicitly NOT Pursuing

** Multi-Platform Support

*Why not*:
- Primary platform is macOS
- Pasteboard functions are macOS-specific
- Cross-platform would dilute integration depth
- Better to optimize for one platform

*Could change if*:
- Start using Linux regularly
- Share with Linux users
- Community interest

** IDE-Like Features

*Why not*:
- This is a writing environment, not a development IDE
- LSP, debugging, etc. are out of scope
- Focus is org-mode and writing
- Spacemacs provides basic code editing

*Philosophy*: Write-first, code-second

** Org-Mode Alternatives

*Why not*:
- Deeply invested in org-mode
- 10+ years of org-roam notes
- Markdown mode would fragment workflow
- Org-mode is the canonical format (philosophy)

*Could change if*:
- Org-mode development stops
- Superior alternative emerges
- Unlikely

** Perfect Consistency

*Why not*:
- "Perfect is the enemy of good"
- Refactoring for aesthetics = busywork
- Working code is valuable
- Incremental improvement is fine

*Philosophy*: Pragmatism over purity

* Tracking and Review

** Monthly Review

Check this document monthly:
- [ ] Are high-priority items progressing?
- [ ] Any new critical issues to add?
- [ ] Can anything move from active → planned → done?
- [ ] Are stretch goals still relevant?

** After Major Changes

Update this document after:
- Fixing significant bugs
- Adding major features
- Spacemacs/Emacs upgrades
- Discovering new technical debt

** Version Milestones

Consider these completion criteria:
- *v2.0*: All [ACTIVE] items resolved
- *v2.5*: All [PLANNED] items resolved
- *v3.0*: Selected stretch goals completed

* Decision Log

Record major decisions here:

** 2025-10-26: Tabled "Document Hydras"
*Reason*: Solo user, hydras are discoverable enough, low ROI

**2025-10-26: Prioritized Regression Tests
*Reason*: Clipboard bugs have cost hours of debugging multiple times

** 2025-10-26: Decided NOT to Pursue Multi-Platform
*Reason*: macOS integration is a core value, would dilute focus
