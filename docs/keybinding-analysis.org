#+author: Generated by Claude

* Overview

This analysis examines your Emacs keybinding usage patterns based on keyfreq data. The goal is to identify optimization opportunities: commands that deserve better bindings, and prime keys that are underutilized.

* Underused Prime Keys

These single-keystroke Command-key bindings have very low usage and could be reassigned to more frequently needed commands.

** Zero Usage (Never Used)

| Binding | Current Command                          | Recommendation                    |
|---------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| s-n     | =make-frame=                               | Reassign - rarely need new frames |
| s-D     | =define-word-at-point=                     | Reassign                          |
| s-E     | =new-email-from-subtree-no-signature=      | Reassign                          |
| s-W     | =open-weeklies=                            | Reassign                          |

** Very Low Usage (1-10 uses)

| Binding | Current Command                                  | Uses | Recommendation                                |

| s-e     | =embark-act=                                       |    1 | Reassign - embark not in your workflow        |
| s-M     | =tr-toggle-transclusion=                           |    1 | Reassign                                      |

| s-r     | =counsel-recentf=                                  |    2 | Reassign - you're not using this              |

| s-j     | =org-todo=                                         |    3 | Keep as the primary org-todo key              |

* Key Observations

** Strengths

1. *Standard macOS bindings are well-used*: s-c, s-v, s-x, s-z, s-s, s-a all have high usage. This is good ergonomic design.

2. *Smart punctuation is working*: =smart-space=, =smart-period=, =comma-or-smart-comma= have thousands of uses, justifying the complexity of these functions.

3. *Navigation is efficient*: Your most-used commands are navigation (word movement, org-shift commands), which have good default bindings.

** Issues



2. *Underutilized prime keys*: 8 Command-key bindings have zero usage. These are valuable ergonomic real estate being wasted.
which ones?

3. *High-frequency command without custom binding*: =right-word= (11,729 uses) and =left-word= (6,353 uses) use the default M-<right>/M-<left>. If you find these awkward, consider binding to something easier.

wtf? that's literally the easiest possible keystroke ?? 

* Recommendations

** Immediate Actions

2. *Reclaim zero-usage keys*: Consider what commands you wish had easier bindings and assign them to:
   - s-r (currently counsel-recentf, 0 uses)
   - s-n (currently make-frame, 0 uses)
   - s-e (currently embark-act, 0 uses)
   - s-D (currently define-word-at-point, 0 uses)

** Suggested Reassignments

Consider these high-value reassignments:

| Key | Current (unused) | Suggested New Command                     | Rationale                                         |
|-----+------------------+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| s-r | counsel-recentf  | =consult-recent-file= or =org-roam-node-find= | Recent files is useful, maybe try consult version |
| s-n | make-frame       | Keep or =org-roam-capture=                  | If you use org-roam capture often                 |
| s-e | embark-act       | =eval-buffer= or =eval-region=                | Quick evaluation                                  |

** Commands That Might Deserve Better Bindings

If you find yourself reaching for these often and wishing they were easier:

- =org-roam-node-find= - if used frequently, deserves a prime key. already bound to (kbd "S-s-<right>") 
- =consult-line= - quick in-buffer search

** Data Collection Note

The report shows "no custom binding" for many commands because the analysis only checks =my/global-key-bindings= and =my/global-map-bindings=. Commands bound via mode-specific maps or Spacemacs defaults appear as unbound even when they have bindings.

* Next Steps

1. Run this analysis again in 2-4 weeks after making changes to see impact
2. Consider adding more mode-specific bindings to the tracking (update =my/keybinding-frequency-report= to check more alists)
3. Review the "no custom binding" high-frequency commands to verify they have acceptable bindings in their respective modes

* 2026-02-10 Updated Analysis (Resolved Bindings)

- The frequency report now resolves bindings from active keymaps per recorded major mode (global + local + minor), and can read the saved keyfreq file even if the package is not loaded in batch.
- High-usage commands already sit on single-key bindings: =right-word= (M-<right>/C-<right>), =left-word= (M-<left>/C-<left>), =smart-space= (SPC), =org-shiftup/down= (S-<up>/<down> plus M-S-<up>/<down> overrides), =smart-return= (<return>).
- No high-usage ergonomic mismatches remain for =org-mode= now that it is bound to =M-o= (single-key). The older =s-k o m= binding can remain as a backup.
- Underused prime single =s-KEY= slots from the updated report: =s-r=, =s-P=, =s-F=, =s-n=, =s-D=, =s-e=, =s-i=, =s-E=, =s-M=, =s-W=. (=s-d= is not available because it is bound to Command-Tab; =s-j= is the remaining =org-todo= binding.)
- In batch generation, minibuffer bindings such as =ivy-next-line= and =vertico-next/exit= may still appear as "(no binding found)" because their maps are not loaded; running the report interactively inside Emacs resolves those.
