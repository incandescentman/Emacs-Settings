#+TITLE: Pasteboard Architecture
#+DATE: 2025-09-24
#+DESCRIPTION: Deep dive into the macOS pasteboard helpers that back clean pasting.

* Overview
- Copy entry points: `pasteboard-copy-adaptive`, `pasteboard-copy-verbatim`, and `pasteboard-copy-and-replace-em-dashes-in-clipboard` (default text-mode cleaner).
- Paste entry points: `pasteboard-paste`, `pasteboard-paste-clean`, `pasteboard-paste-verbatim` (`pasteboard-paste-raw` alias), and `pasteboard-paste-adjusted-subtrees`.
- Goal: Move text from macOS apps into Org buffers while normalizing typography, Markdown, and Org semantics.

* Evolution History
- Early version just called `shell-command-on-region` with `pbpaste`.
- Added multi-stage cleaners (`replace-smart-quotes`, markdown converters) to support blogging and knowledge-base workflows.
- 2025-09-24 regression fix: table separator protection via smarter `normalize-dashes`.
- 2025-09-24 regression fix: emoji joiner preservation inside `replace-weird-spaces`.
- 2025-10-05 critical fix: markdown bold `**text**` → org bold `*text*` conversion order and heading detection.

* Current Implementation Details
- `pasteboard--clean-string` processes text in this order (ORDER MATTERS):
  1. `convert-markdown-headings-to-org` - MUST run first before asterisk processing
  2. `replace-smart-quotes` - Converts markdown bold `**` → org bold `*`, smart quotes, etc.
  3. `replace-smart-quotes-regexp`
  4. `replace-weird-spaces`
  5. `convert-markdown-blockquotes-to-org`
  6. `convert-markdown-links-to-org-mode`
  7. Narrowed pass: `asterisk-to-dash-and-convert-code-blocks-to-org` (if available)
- `normalize-dashes` (in `shared-functions`) now skips lines that look like Markdown tables.
- Raw helpers wrap `pbpaste` with `perl -p -e 's/\r$//'` and `tr` to remove carriage returns.

* Performance and Reliability Considerations
- Cleaning runs in-buffer; large pastes pay the cost per regex pass—acceptable for short articles but consider profiling if >5k lines.
- Use markers to avoid mis-calculating the end point when cleaners change text length.
- Failure cases usually stem from outside dependencies (`pbpaste`, shell pipeline). Keep Terminal permissions granted under System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility.

* Lessons Learned
- Treat each sanitizer as a suspect when formats break; add fixtures before altering their logic.
- Keep macOS-specific shell invocations isolated so Linux builds can fall back to `xclip` in the future.
- Update `/docs/instructions.org` whenever key bindings or cleaner order changes to prevent drift.
- See `/docs/codebase-wisdom.org` for detailed debugging post-mortems on markdown conversion and emoji handling issues.
