* 2025-01-27: Fixed org-inline-tags font-lock highlighting

* 2025-10-02: Stabilised org-element cache interactions

** Summary
- Wrapped high-frequency editing commands (`smart-return`, `smart-space`, and `my/delete-backward-and-capitalize`) in `combine-after-change-calls` transactions so Org’s cache only re-syncs once per keystroke
- Reworked pasteboard helpers to pre-process text in temp buffers before insertion and added reusable clipboard utilities
- Guarded the pasteboard cleaner’s narrowing step with refreshed `(point-min)/(point-max)` bounds so Markdown conversions no longer raise `args-out-of-range`
- Added a focus-in hook that force-resets the element cache for Dropbox-synchronised org-roam buffers to avoid stale offsets after external edits
- Verified the previous org-element cache warnings no longer reproduce with the hardened helpers
- Restored the `convert-markdown-links-to-org-mode` helper so the new pasteboard pipeline can safely normalise Markdown links before insertion

** Notes
- Batch compiled/tangled the touched modules to ensure they load cleanly in isolation
- `shared-functions.el` still expects optional packages (vertico, projectile, ox-twbs); run inside a full config before evaluating the new cache reset hook

** Problem
The org-inline-tags feature was defined but tags like #todo, #review, #inlinetags were not appearing in the configured orange color. They remained the same color as surrounding text.

** Struggles & Difficulties Encountered

*** 1. Initial Font-Lock Function Approach Failed
- First attempted to use a function `org-inline-tags--composed-face` in the font-lock rule
- Font-lock expected either a face name or a properly structured face expression, not a function call that returns a face
- The function was never actually being called by the font-lock system

*** 2. Conflict with Existing Org-Mode Font-Lock Rules
- Encountered error: "No match 2 in highlight (2 'org-headline-done prepend)"
- Our font-lock pattern was somehow interfering with org-mode's existing font-lock rules
- The error suggested font-lock was trying to access match group 2 that didn't exist in our pattern

*** 3. Partial Fontification Issue
- Even after fixing the errors, tags would only turn orange when typing a space after them
- Existing tags in the buffer were not being fontified
- Font-lock was only applying to newly typed text, not retroactively to existing content

** Solution

The final working solution combined two approaches:

*** 1. Simplified Font-Lock Rule
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-inline-tags-setup-font-lock ()
  "Setup font-lock for inline tags in org-mode."
  (font-lock-add-keywords
   nil
   '(("\\(#\\w+\\(?:-\\w+\\)*\\)"
      (1 'org-inline-tags-face t)))
   t))
#+END_SRC

- Used a simple direct face name instead of a function
- Match group 1 captures just the tag content
- The `t` flag overwrites any existing face (instead of `prepend` which was causing conflicts)

*** 2. Manual Buffer Fontification
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-inline-tags-fontify-buffer ()
  "Manually fontify all inline tags in the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward "#\\w+\\(?:-\\w+\\)*" nil t)
      (let ((start (match-beginning 0))
            (end (match-end 0)))
        (put-text-property start end 'face 'org-inline-tags-face)
        (put-text-property start end 'font-lock-face 'org-inline-tags-face)))))
#+END_SRC

- Manually searches through buffer and applies face properties
- Sets both `face` and `font-lock-face` properties to ensure persistence
- Called immediately when enabling the mode to fontify existing tags

** Key Learnings

1. **Font-lock expects specific structures**: Can't just pass a function that returns a face; must use either a face name directly or a matcher function that follows font-lock conventions

2. **Existing font-lock rules can conflict**: When adding keywords to modes with complex font-lock setups like org-mode, conflicts with existing patterns are common

3. **Font-lock doesn't retroactively apply**: Need to manually fontify existing buffer content or force a complete refontification

4. **Both `face` and `font-lock-face` properties may be needed**: Setting both ensures the highlighting persists through various buffer operations
