* 2025-12-06: Fix paths and display settings
- Updated ~goals-agenda.el~ to use CloudStorage paths (~~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/~)
- Changed master task list path from ~data/~ to ~goals/~ subdirectory
- Added "DELL U3223QE" to ~jay/notch-display-identifiers~ for external monitor support

* 2025-12-06: Improve double-line-breaks-in-region function
- Rewrote ~double-line-breaks-in-region~ in ~shared-functions.org~ to fix several issues:
  - Now normalizes Windows (~\r\n~) and old Mac (~\r~) line endings first
  - Collapses 3+ consecutive newlines to exactly 2
  - Only doubles single newlines, leaving existing double breaks unchanged
  - Fixed boundary handling so newlines at region start/end are processed
- Added keybinding ~s-k d l~ in ~gnu-emacs-startup.org~

* 2025-12-01: Add invisible space handling to html2org-clipboard
- Added ~\u202F~ (narrow no-break space) replacement to ~chatgpt2org.el~
- Added ~\u200B~ (zero-width space) removal to ~chatgpt2org.el~
- These characters were causing issues when pasting from Instagram DMs
- Already handled in ~pasteboard-copy-and-paste-functions.el~ via ~smart-quotes-replacement-pairs~ and ~replace-weird-spaces~, but ~html2org-clipboard~ uses a separate code path via ~chatgpt2org~
