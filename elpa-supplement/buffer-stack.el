;;; Commentary
;;
;; This is tested with XEmacs 21.4 and GNU Emacs 21.
;;
;; If you have used "Alt-Tab" in Windows, you know the basic principle
;; behind this buffer model. Your buffers are in a stack, with the
;; most recent on top. When you want a new buffer, you scan through
;; them until you find the one you want, and then it goes on top of
;; the stack. Unlike cycle-buffer, the list is not rearranged until
;; you find the buffer you want, so you can easily jump back to where
;; you started.
;;
;; This has some further enhancements. You can filter the stack in
;; different ways; see `buffer-stack-filter'. You can use the
;; frame-local buffer ordering; see `buffer-stack-frame-local'. You
;; can monitor your position in different ways; see
;; `buffer-stack-show-position'. And you can bury/kill buffers while
;; switching through the stack; see `buffer-stack-bury'.
;;
;; To use, put this file in your library path. In your .emacs or
;; init.el, put:
;;
;; (require 'buffer-stack)
;;
;; I use these key-bindings:
;;
;; (global-set-key [(f9)] 'buffer-stack-bury)
;; (global-set-key [(control f9)] 'buffer-stack-bury-and-kill)
;; (global-set-key [(f10)] 'buffer-stack-up)
;; (global-set-key [(f11)] 'buffer-stack-down)
;; (global-set-key [(f12)] 'buffer-stack-track)
;; (global-set-key [(control f12)] 'buffer-stack-untrack)
;;
;; See the customization group `buffer-stack' for settings. If you
;; want to preserve settings between sessions (i.e. tracked/untracked
;; buffers), just save them in custom. If you don't like custom,
;; setting variables manually after load is also respected.
;;
;; This is similar to some other libraries which I didn't know about
;; when I first wrote it, though in my opinion (of course) it's better.

;; Thanks to gerds@paracelsus.fdm.uni-freiburg.de for feedback and
;; requesting the inclusive stack, deego@glue.umd.edu for feedback,
;; LathI for requesting frame-local stacks, and someone on EmacsWiki
;; for suggesting indirectly `buffer-stack-show-position-buffers'.

;;; Bugs
;;
;; The switch from a frame-local to a global stack in GNU Emacs can
;; start you with a strange ordering.
;;
;; Untracked buffers may get rearranged relative to tracked ones.
;;
;; You need to use the buffer-stack-* commands directly with
;; keybindings; `M-x buffer-stack-*' will not work, because this
;; changes `last-command'.


;;; ChangeLog

;; 1.5 2002-06-30
;;      Filter and show position can now be user functions. Fixed a
;;      conceivable (but incredibly rare) bug with the buffer list
;;      rearranging itself while switching.

;; 1.4 2002-06-28
;;      Polishing to a fine sheen.

;; 1.3 2002-06-27
;;      Can show previous and next buffers in stack.

;; 1.2 2002-06-27
;;      Workaround for broken GNU Emacs bury-buffer.

;; 1.1 2002-06-23
;;      New implementation which uses buffer-list directly. Dropping
;;      frame-local-tracking, mountain stack. Works with GNU Emacs!

;; 1.0 2002-06-23
;;      Sealing corner cases and fixing bugs in frame-local usage.

;; 0.9 2002-06-18
;;      Public release. Includes customization variables.

;; 0.3--0.4b 2002-06-16
;;      First attempts at frame-local and inclusive-mode features.

;; 0.1--0.2 2002-06-13
;;      Initial release and minor correction. Basic mountain stack.
