* LaTeX Subtitle Support for Org-Mode Export

This module adds support for subtitles in LaTeX export from org-mode files using the tilde (~) syntax.

** Features

- Lines starting with =~= in org files are converted to LaTeX subtitle environments
- Different subtitle sizes based on heading level:
  - =\section= → =subtitle= environment (28pt in elegant-garamond, large in beautiful-racket)
  - =\subsection= → =subsubtitle= environment (17pt/normalsize)
  - =\subsubsection= → =subsubsubtitle= environment (13pt/small)
- Works with both numbered and unnumbered sections
- Automatically fixes already-converted subtitle environments to use correct levels

** Usage

*** In Org Files

Simply prefix any line with =~= to make it a subtitle:

#+begin_example
* Main Section
~ This becomes a section subtitle

** Subsection
~ This becomes a subsection subtitle

*** Subsubsection
~ This becomes a subsubsection subtitle
#+end_example

*** Loading

The module is automatically loaded when you run =jay-load-latex= or when LaTeX export is triggered.

To manually load:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "/Users/jay/emacs/emacs-settings/latex-subtitles/latex-subtitles.el")
#+end_src

** Files

- [[file:latex-subtitles.el][latex-subtitles.el]] - Main filter implementation
- [[file:latex-subtitle-test-file.org][latex-subtitle-test-file.org]] - Test file demonstrating subtitle usage

** Technical Details

The implementation uses an =org-export-filter-final-output-functions= filter that:
1. Tracks the current heading level while processing the LaTeX output
2. Converts =\textasciitilde{}= (escaped tildes) to appropriate subtitle environments
3. Also fixes existing =\begin{subtitle}= environments to use the correct level based on context

** LaTeX Template Requirements

The LaTeX templates (elegant-garamond, beautiful-racket) define the subtitle environments:

#+begin_src latex
% For sections
\newenvironment{subtitle}{...}{...}

% For subsections
\newenvironment{subsubtitle}{...}{...}

% For subsubsections
\newenvironment{subsubsubtitle}{...}{...}
#+end_src

These are already defined in:
- =latex-templates/elegant-garamond.el=
- =latex-templates/beautiful-racket.el=
