* keybindings

Let's use s-/ f as a prefix for searching filenames, and s-/ g as a prefix for searching full text using grep

Using ~s-/ f~ and ~s-/ g~ as prefix keybindings for searching filenames
and full text, respectively, is a logical choice.



* search
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Search
(global-set-key (kbd "s-/ dg") 'deadgrep-current-directory) ; not incremental. but nicely formatted. lays it all out nicely in a buffer.
(global-set-key (kbd "s-/ pa") 'counsel-projectile-ag) ; as an alternative to deadgrep check out ag so maybe it's better

(global-set-key (kbd "s-/ rg") 'consult-ripgrep-current-directory) ; pretty slick, shows you the actual file context

(global-set-key (kbd "s-k rg") 'consult-ripgrep-current-directory) ; pretty slick, shows you the actual file context

* searching current directory instead of project directory
By default, consult-ripgrep it uses the *project directory* of the current buffer. [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74462/how-to-properly-use-consult-ripgrep-to-search-through-org-roam-notes][If you want to change it to the *current directory*, you can either pass it explicitly as an argument, or use a prefix argument (C-u) to prompt for the directory]][[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74462/how-to-properly-use-consult-ripgrep-to-search-through-org-roam-notes][^{2}]].

You can define a custom function that calls consult-ripgrep with the current directory as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun consult-ripgrep-current-directory ()
 "Search current directory using consult-ripgrep."
 (interactive)
 (consult-ripgrep default-directory))


(defun deadgrep-current-directory ()
 "Search current directory using deadgrep."
 (interactive)
 (let ((search-term (read-string "Search term: ")))
  (deadgrep search-term default-directory)))

(defalias 'deadgrep 'deadgrep-project-directory)

(defalias 'rg-current-directory 'rg-dwim-current-dir)
(defalias 'rg-project-directory 'rg-dwim-project-dir)
(defalias 'rg-current-file 'rg-dwim-current-file)

* consult org roam
~consult-org-roam.el~ provides several functions to connect [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] to [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]]'s completing read interface.

First, it provides the following standalone functions which enhance =org-roam='s capabilities:

- ~consult-org-roam-file-find~ :: Search your org-roam files with consult's completing-read and its live preview
- ~consult-org-roam-backlinks~ :: List backlinks to ~org-roam-node-at-point~ (e.g. currently open note) and sift through them with consult's completing-read and its live preview
- ~consult-org-roam-forward-links~ :: List forward links contained in the currently opened note
- ~consult-org-roam-search~ :: [[https://github.com/minad/consult#asynchronous-search][Asynchronously search]] your roam-directory
 with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html][grep]] or [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]

Second, it provides a minor mode called ~consult-org-roam-mode~. When activated, ~org-roam-node-read~ is overridden, which is used by ~org-roam-node-find~, ~org-roam-node-insert~ and ~org-roam-refile~. By doing so, all functions utilizing completing-read resort to ~consult~ for performing completion. Furthermore, the same is done for ~org-roam-ref-read~ so that ~consult~ is used for completing references as well.

Eventually, you might want to suppress previewing for certain functions. This can be done by adding using consult-customize.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package consult-org-roam
  :ensure t
  :after org-roam
  :init
  (require 'consult-org-roam)

  ;; Configure a custom narrow key for `consult-buffer'
  (consult-org-roam-buffer-narrow-key ?r)
  ;; Display org-roam buffers right after non-org-roam buffers
  ;; in consult-buffer (and not down at the bottom)
  (consult-org-roam-buffer-after-buffers t)
  :config
  ;; Eventually suppress previewing for certain functions
  (consult-customize
  consult-org-roam-forward-links
  :preview-key (kbd "M-."))
  :bind
  ;; Define some convenient keybindings as an addition

** simultaneously search both directories
In this function:

- ~directory-files-recursively~ is used to get a list of all files in
  each directory (~dir1~ and ~dir2~).
- These lists are concatenated into ~all-files~.
- ~ivy-read~ is then used to create an interactive selection interface
  with the combined file list.

*** Explanation of How the Code Works:


1. *Interactive Declaration*: ~(interactive)~ makes this function a command that can be called interactively within Emacs, for example, using ~M-x~.
2. *Directory Definitions*: The paths ~/Users/jay/Dropbox/writing/proposal/~ and ~/Users/jay/Dropbox/writing/book/~ are set as ~dir1~ and ~dir2~ respectively. These represent the two directories you want to search.
3. *Listing Files*:
   - ~directory-files-recursively~ is used for both ~dir1~ and ~dir2~ to create a list of all files within these directories and their subdirectories. The empty string ~""~ argument means it lists all types of files without filtering by extension.
4. *Combining File Lists*: The lists ~files1~ and ~files2~ are combined into a single list ~all-files~ using ~append~. This list now contains file paths from both directories.
5. *Interactive File Selection*:
   - ~ivy-read~ is used to create an interactive selection interface. It takes ~all-files~ as the list of choices to present to the user.
   - The prompt ~"Find file: "~ is displayed to the user.
6. *File Selection Action*:
   - The ~:action~ argument defines what to do when the user selects a file.
   - It uses a lambda function ~(lambda (f) (when f (find-file f)))~ to open the selected file. The ~when~ statement ensures that an action is only taken if a file is actually selected (i.e., ~f~ is not ~nil~).

This function provides a user-friendly way to search and open files from two different directories using Emacs's ~ivy~ completion system, offering a seamless integration with your Emacs workflow.
